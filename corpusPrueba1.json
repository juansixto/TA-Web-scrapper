{"text":"Had a short stay here in January with my wife. Rooms are beautiful and the service was fantastic...kinda felt like you were visiting friends ! After a night out we were welcomed back and shared a bottle of wine (or two!) with the owner and a couple of his friends and a couple of guests ! Just excellent. Would certainly recommend !","title":"\u201cFantastic !\u201d","location":3,"service":5,"value":5,"cleanliness":5,"date":"28 April 2013 NEW","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}{"text":"We arrived for one nights stay on Easter Saturday to a very warm and friendly greeting by Anita. We were offered a choice of rooms as there was 2 available and chose the one on the top floor with a four poster bed. Wow what a fabulous room!!! In fact the whole house is beautiful, and is furnished to a very high standard with some wonderful antiques. Later my nephew who lives nearby called in to see if we had arrived ok. Anita came to our room to inform us that we had a visitor and then she promptly made a pot of tea for us all which was brought to us in longe. Later that evening I popped downstairs to see if they had a number for a local taxi and was told that if we came down when we were ready Anita would call one and we could have a glass of wine whilst we were waiting. Breakfast was fantastic and the overall service could not have been better. I would definitely recommend this guesthouse and will almost certainly visit again when I'm next in the area.

She booked The Villas Residence for one night & it was absolutely the right decision. We were met by the owner, Paul, who greeted us & looked after us more like family than paying guests. As we were the first guests to arrive on the Saturday afternoon so Paul showed us around the rooms and let us make the choice. We chose the Victorian room, which overlooked he front gardens. It was a good size, well furnished with great light. It's not en suite but the bathroom which is right next door is beautifully & expensively equipped so it's no hardship at all. My wife had a great soak in the Jacuzzi bath as we prepared to go out for dinner. Before we left the hotel for Nutters, we had a very pleasant glass of wine with the other guests in the very comfortable sitting room. Overnight, we had a great sleep in the huge, ornate bed. The linen was possibly the crispest I've ever slept in and made for a very comfortable night. Breakfast, the next morning, was made to order and was most excellent. The staff were polite, discreet, interested & attentive & nothing was too much trouble. Overall, this was a great experience & we would not hesitate to return or recommend it to others. Congratulations to Paul & his team for creating an oasis of tranquility & refinement in an increasingly hectic world.

We arrived on a Saturday. There was a power cut as workmen had cut cables on main road! Didn't matter though. Spent late afternoon in candle light with Paul and guests, chatting, drinking wine, relaxing, having a laugh. Rooms amazing. Host, very cool. Breakfast, probably the best I've eaten! The place rocks. I'm a Brighton lad, I'm quite cosmopolitan. Only came up North to pick up some new wheels for my motor! Me and my missus will be coming back. Thanks Paul.

Furnished with great skill, mixing modern amenities with charming antiques. Warm, welcoming, very country-house traditional with great hospitality from both the manager and staff. Excellent breakfast with some of the best home-made marmalade I have ever tasted. Cannot recommend highly enough. Top-spec bathroom is next door (so not quite en-suite) although fluffy bathrobes were provided so no worries on that front! I cannot think of a thing they could do to make this better - superb in every way.","title":"\u201cWhat a find!\u201d","location":4,"service":5,"value":5,"cleanliness":5,"date":"18 March 2013","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}{"text":"super beautiful English style house, super comfortable, super nice staff and reasonable rate.

Very small. intimate. Rooms are like an Aladdin's cave. So unique. Great furnishings. Antiques everywhere. So warm. So welcoming. I don't think I have come across rooms of this high standard anywhere. Real attention to detail. This is a real hidden gem. I am amazed at the price. Unbelievable value for money. The host/manager cannot do enough for you.Shared a glass of wine with him and had a good chat. Every hotel should be like this. This really does set the standard for others to follow. Blown away by my experience. Town centre just a couple of minutes walk but you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere. If money was no object, this is how I would have my house. Love it. Will be back time and time again. If you need a hotel in Rochdale, honestly, don't look any further. Tried the rest. This is head and shoulders above the rest. Room Tip: All amazing and truly unique.

The hotel is stunning inside and out. Paul is very attentive, friendly and can't do enough to help. I would strongly recommend a stay here at least once. It's a great place to stay if you fancy a meal at Nutters Restaurant and don't fancy a long drive home. All the rooms are finished to a very high standard and all are unique in their own right.

The house is a fantastically well converted period property with spacious rooms, high ceilings and endless original features. It's been very stylishly but sympathetically decorated with some lovely pieces and lots of well-placed details in each room. This gives it a classy show home, or magazine shoot feel, but without any pretension - still a very relaxing place despite having a sense of occasion. There are 6 bespoke rooms, each with its own unique style; we stayed in the front room that has a Chinese/Asian theme, and came with lots of interesting antiquities and pieces to admire. Our room was en-suite with a large and super comfy bed and lovely duvet and pillows. We also had the option to take the room in the attic
