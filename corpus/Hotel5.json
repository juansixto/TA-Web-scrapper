Like chastised children we agreed and sat like good girls till 2.30.! How petty can you get and I felt so embarrassed in front of all my friends! It wasn't even busy! When we went to settle the bill we were told off because three of the party wanted to pay by card!! It took her 15inutes to pay bill how difficult is that ? ! All the way through the afternoon tea we had to try and attract their attention to get more tea ?

{"User":"TheCelticCrusaders","Cities":4,"text":"Before you read this, we have to say the hotel staff are excellent, friendly and frankly cover up for the lack of everything else at the hotel. Having carefully selected Coombe Abbey over many historical hotels within a 3/4 hour drive of each other, we were both looking forward to 24 hours of relaxation in a historic high class hotel. The trip was a well-deserved overnight stay without the children. On arriving at the hotel, our first experience was the great difficulty in trying to park! This was understandable when we reached reception. We found that there were 2 weddings, a business function and numerous parties taking place that afternoon, no wonder the car park was full! On arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist and advised our room was ready, wonderful news as we had arrived an hour early. We walked to the room, so we could take in the hotel but were surprised to see much worn carpets, thread bare in places! We visited the room and I felt a tad let down, not the feature room I expected for £159! We made the long trip to the car to collect our overnight bags and went back to the room (I have to say the hotel porter did offer to assist and was very helpful) After having another look around the room and still feeling slightly let down, we decided to venture downstairs for a nice look around this historical hotel. We to like the other couple were questioned as to what we were doing and ushered back to the foyer, we were a bit put out as frankly there was no-one for us to go, it was pouring with rain outside so a lovely walk around the gardens was out of the question and with 2 weddings and numerous parties taking place, we couldn't find anywhere to sit!!! We then decided to grab something to eat and drink, the one bar was full of wedding guests, so ventured to the garden restaurant and bar, to be told we are full sorry, so we hung around until a table in the bar area was available and ordered our food at the bar (not really what I had in mind TBH) When the food arrived, we would have to say it was lovely and excellent VFM, served by lovely friendly staff. We then had a relaxing late lunch and drink, and ventured off to see if we could enjoy the surroundings of the foyer as time was moving on and it seemed to be a little quieter. We did manage to find a seat, where we could look around and enjoy the hotel. We arrived back in our room and after a brief relax, it was time to enjoy the roll top bath, filled with lovely hot water and bubbles it really was time to now relax, until I noticed all the dust on the floor behind the door, down to the back wall (not what you expect) Ready we went for dinner, on arrival we were seated in a nice spot and we ordered our drinks, 15 minutes later the wine arrived and a prompt apology was given for the lateness as due to the weddings that had/were taking place they struggled to find a wine cooler (again the staff were lovely) After a lovely meal, which was nice and relaxed, (until you popped to the rest rooms and were greeted with lots of wedding guests) we left the restaurant around 10:45pm and ventured into the foyer to once again take in the beauty of the hotel, it was lovely and quiet, then the noise started, wedding guests had decided to come back into the foyer and that is where the hotel was let down, it was F this F that and frankly behaviour that was more for a back alley than a hotel or any public house. We then took our leave and went to our room. A comfortable bed, which gave a lovely night\u2019s sleep, until I woke and found the curtains were so thread bare that the sun was shining through broken materials (£159 per night , please change the curtains) Up ready and down to breakfast, gosh it was busy!! Very busy in fact a real struggle for the staff to find a table! Toast yes please Bread oh no toast, again the staff was fantastic and this was dealt with promptly. Eggs? Where are you - sorry coming now Sausages? Where are you - sorry coming now Bacon? Where are you - sorry coming now All this could be avoided if they provided breakfast as most high class hotels do, they cook and serve after asking what you would like! Instead of a buffet style breakfast with empty containers. It was then time, for a lovely stroll around the grounds before returning to our room and checking out, never to return. The hotel was not what I expected, having stayed not 6 months earlier and another high calibre hotel not 30 minutes\u2019 drive away they were completely different worlds. Coombe Abbey has history, great staff but is lacking on that uniqueness and exclusivity that comes from staying at a nice hotel, it is apparent that Coombe Abbey are more about packing people in than creating a special ambiance. My motto is more quality and less quantity! Very disappointed with the hotel, but a wonderful 24 hours all the same as you have to make the most of a bad thing and try to justify in your head what you have just spent £300 on!!

{"User":"Sarahctaylor","Cities":0,"text":"This was recommended to us, and paid for as a treat, by my in laws. We have three children and stressful jobs so a break away is not only very rare- but also very very needed. The building is amazing, inside and out. However it became clear that we did not have the appearance of wealth that they are perhaps accustomed to. Firstly we were in the room next to the lift, which obviously resulted in very broken nights sleep and definitely NO lie in. Having said that the room was stunning, with a luxurious corner bath in the room itself and was very clean. We were only given one towel to share, and had to locate a maid for a second. As the building is so rich in history it invites you to explore- which we did on the first evening. We were very quickly discovered by a member of staff who requested to know what we were doing and whether we were guests at the hotel. This would be understandable if we were somewhere we shouldn't have been, but as we were walking down a corridor lined with descriptive history I can only assume that we were thought to be intruders. The very polite member if staff walked us back through to the lobby and sat us in the in the outside the toilets whilst he collected our drinks from the bar for us. I suspect he also did a quick check as to whether we were actually guests- he took a very long time to bring our drinks back. We decided to take said drinks to our room and listen to the other guests retiring to their rooms. No alarm call needed the following morning with our room location, so we were up nice and early for breakfast, which was lovely and very well organised. We then used the facilities at the virgin gym. This is a 10 minute drive, but well worth the trip. Facilities and staff at the gym are faultless. We had a table booked in the restaurant that evening, and having smelt the food cooking during the afternoon we were really looking forward to it. There is a dress code in the restaurant which makes the occasion more memorable. The restaurant was not too busy when we sat down and our orders were taken immediately. As we chatted and time passed it became apparent that we had been forgotten about. The tables around us had seated after us and were either finishing dessert, or retiring to the lounge - our starters had not even arrived. This would be understandable if they were short staffed and busy, but the restaurant was not full and staff were being very attentive to other tables. We managed to alert a member of staff and our starters arrived. The food was delicious!!! It was well worth the wait, but I felt slightly short changed when one of the waitresses genuinely appeared grateful that we hadn't created a scene. I am not one for creating a scene(what would the point be??) but realised that they felt we could tolerate second class service without complaining because we do not have the money to spend with them often. I may be wrong, and our experiences may be coincidental but I out stay there was something special for us, but we felt like second class citizens to them- so beware!!!!","title":"\u201cAmazing building, but not so amazing serv\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":1,"service":3,"value":2,"Location":"Lichfield, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"14 April 2013","sleepQ":1,"rooms":5}

{"User":"Tim M","Cities":6,"text":"Having previously stayed at Thornbury Castle in Bristol, I wasn't sure whether it was possible to stay anywhere comparable. I was wrong. We booked a Sunday night stay over the Easter weekend as a bit of a treat and got to the Abbey at around 4:30pm. We were greeted by the most magnificent sight as we walked into the main reception as the desk lies at the heart of the old Abbey, adjacent to the pulpit! The greeting by the staff was as good as the setting and we were booked in quickly before being given directions to our room! The directions were required as the building can be a bit of a maze, but definitely one you'd be happy to get lost in. Every corridor features things to gawp at or rooms to wander into. Our room, 148 was a feature bedchamber overlooking the courtyard and fountain outside the front of the building. All mod-cons were there as well as some old ones! The only issue, and I'm really nitpicking here as we were on a break from the rat race, is that the WIFI reception was rubbish anywhere but in reception, we got none in our room. The four poster bed was huge, the bathroom magnificaent, and the furnishings spot on. We decidied to eat in the restaurant downstairs and that too turned out to be a great decision. A la carte food for £34.50 each with exceptional service and absolutely incredible food. The whole experience, including breakfast the following morning, was a 5* star experience, what made it better was the attitude of the staff. They couldn't do enough and the porter on the last day was more than happy to show us around the grounds and the magnificently decorated outbuildings on site too.

{"User":"silverfox1942","Cities":42,"text":"My Wife and I had a one night break using a Groupon deal which was for a Crown Room and breakfast. The room was of adequate size and nicely furnished in a period style. The weather was very cold but the room was lovely and warm. The bathroom was clean and old fashioned with a pull chain toilet and a massive Victorian hand basin. The shower was a large copper headed over bath type but was like standing under Niagara! We ate in the restaurant and although the service was a bit on the slow side, the food was of a high standard. Breakfast consists of both a cold continental buffet and a hot English buffet as you wish with a waitress bringing pots of tea or coffee. The interior of the Hotel is quirky and interesting and the Staff were all very pleasant. The grounds around the Hotel are in effect a country park open to the public. There are many delightful walks on flat easy ground with a large area of lake and streams with lots of water birds to add to the interest.

The wide choices of tea were excellent & the cakes/sandwiches we were provided with were very tasty, of a high quality & very well presented - not to mention clean. However, the staff may as well have not worn their uniform since they didnt act very professional in front of those who were dining, as they were discussing problems/issues loudly in front of the entire dining area for everyone to see - i even noticed the main waitor speaking to a lady member of staff horribly. I weren't impressed by this but as for my own individual experience when I brought them over they were polite & well mannered, however, since I had saw how they treated others when not in our full presence it seemed like an act. Also, I don't expect a posh place like this to allow their staff to wear hooped earrings, both male and female.","title":"\u201cGreat experience, food &amp; drink, poor staff\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":1,"service":0,"value":0,"Location":"","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":1,"date":"2 April 2013","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}

We were lucky enough to be seated in the little gazebo in the room which made the experience feel extra special. I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a lovely romantic break. (Just a small note I will mention is that we ate in the restaurant in the evening and the food was very good quality but there were quite a few service issues due to the volume of people staying and the only choice on offer was the set menu, but I have only reviewed the hotel here.

From the impressive drive in, stunning reception and glorious orangery to the most sumptuous bedrooms ever.

Breakfast is a lazy affair relaxing in pleasant surroundings and offers a huge range and choice of food. The staff are exceptionally helpful and nothing appears to be too much trouble. If I had one criticism it would be the slightly longer than normal walk from the car park to be hotel (across the moat) but don't feel that this is something that should deter visitors - the experience once inside makes up for this 100 fold.

{"User":"Beverley M","Cities":6,"text":"We stayed on Saturday 29th March 2013, on the Romancing at Coombe package. We upgraded to a Feature Bedchamber for an extra special night which included Chocs, Champagne, flowers and Dinner in the Garden Restaurant. We were a little early to check in and the room was not ready which we expected. Reception were very polite, friendly and helpful and offered to come and fetch us from the bar when the room was ready. We had a drinkie and the room was ready, on time, and we were delighted to find that we had been upgraded to a Grand feature bedchamber in the annexe. Thanks very much for that! the room was stunning. very large, with period furniture and a vary large four poster bed which was very comfortable. Snacks, a drop of Sherry, fruit and all the bits and bobs you'd expect. The bathroom had a shower, but upstairs (via the spiral staircase, was a room with a roll top Victorian style bath with nice quality products to luxuriate in. I thought I'd never get my wife out of there. Later that evening we had dinner after a couple of drinks in the bar. Service was excellent, both from the Maître D. (Sorry forgot his name, a very nice Greek Gentleman who gave us some great tips for a forthcoming trip to Kos) and Angelina our waitress who was efficient, friendly and attentive, there were others who we can't remember names of but all were great. Dinner was 3 courses, all of which were excellent (and we're pretty picky when it comes to food) particularly the scallops and pork cheek starter which was genuinely top drawer. We retired soon after dinner to take advantage of the lovely room. Despite two weddings, we had a quiet and relaxing sleep. Breakfast was delicious with again excellent service from the two girls on. (one from Dinner the previous night). Checkout was a breeze and the bill was correct despite some mixing and matching on our part with upgrading champagne for a better vintage and meals etc. All in all we had a great stay and will definitely be back if we possibly can. (Halloween would be fantastic, it's kind of gothic inside in places). A couple of minus points for balance. The bar outside the Garden restaurant was rather slow to serve and the staff a little preoccupied with other matters, possibly the wedding parties. We would probably have stayed and had a few drinks after dinner but it's not particularly inviting (and the only decent beer was off). Signage for arriving guests needs attending to as we hauled luggage from the car parks to reception when with hindsight we could have dropped the luggage at reception first and driven the car back. These are minor points and didn't detract from a very nice stay in a beautiful hotel. Well done and thanks!","title":"\u201cExcellent Romantic break.\u201d","hotelReviews":3,"location":5,"Reviews":12,"service":4,"value":5,"Location":"Stourbridge, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":9,"date":"31 March 2013","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

After getting a little bad news my Mother and I drove past Coombe Abbey on the way home, in fact after living in the local for over 28 years my Mother announced that she had never been inside, so I took a left turn and decided to treat her to afternoon tea. Philippe found us a table despite having no booking, we were lucky as it was 2:30pm and slowly the beautiful conservatory filled with generations of ladies enjoying the stoic English tradition of afternoon tea (actually there was one man partaking too). A three tiered platter arrived with a selection of savoury sandwiches, scones and double cream, cup cakes, and rocky road slice topped off with mini eggs, and delightfully light macarons to challenge Laduree's, apparently all made in the kitchen at Coombe Abbey. The price was exceptionally reasonable and I would say that I enjoyed this more than Kilworth House Hotel's afternoon tea offering. We are going back next week to try the savoury afternoon tea.....fresh baked warm cheese scones....yum!!","title":"\u201cTea for Two - What a Treat\u201d","hotelReviews":4,"location":5,"Reviews":9,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Nuneaton, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":7,"date":"28 March 2013","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}
{"User":"sthomson1987","Cities":2,"text":"My fiancee and I arrived late March for a relaxing weekend away. The building and grounds themselves are beautiful, and inside there are some amazing features, so our expectations were immediately very high for a great weekend. However, it was clear when we arrived that there was a wedding taking place, and so the hotel was really full. It took us about 10 minutes to actually check in, due to the crowds of people from the wedding party congregating around reception. When we finally were checked in, we made our way to our 'feature bedchamber', which was a small corner room with a tiny (i.e. definitely seemed smaller than a standard double) four poster bed cramped into the corner. To be fair, the room was very clean and the bathroom was clearly modern. However, the room itself was incredibly dingy,even with the curtains fully opened and all the lights turned on. It did not feel welcoming or comfortable at all... We went for afternoon tea, but it was fully booked. The staff did offer to serve us if we found a table out near reception, which we did in the end as we were very hungry. There seemed to be a lot of 'new' staff working there, as we had to enquire with multiple people to even get served, and then we eventually ended up being charged twice for our afternoon tea (which in fairness was corrected as soon as it was raised). The scones were very tasty though once they arrived, it would've just been nice to have them in the restaurant rather than out in the foyer. We were booked for dinner also that night, and the dinner was incredibly disappointing. I had the misfortune of paying £20+ for the turbot, which was literally a lump of white fish with a little red wine sauce scrawled on it. My fiancee's lamb was very disappointing also. To bulk it out a bit, I ordered a side order of chips, which were LITERALLY McDonalds chips - bog standard wet french fries. We actually returned them to the kitchen in disbelief that this was so-called 'fine dining'. I personally felt very aggrieved about the £98 bill we managed to accumulate, bearing in mind we only had 2-courses each + a bottle of wine. Not value for money whatsoever. To top it off, we had clearly been put in a room next to several people from the wedding party, who were up running, yelling and banging about in the corridor all night, meaning we barely slept that night and I woke up feeling absolutely exhausted the next morning - so much for a relaxing chill out weekend! I think this could have been so much better, all the ingredients were there but I think we had a combination of bad luck and bad service. If I did ever decide to go back, I'd have to avoid going at a weekend over the summer months, purely to avoid another wedding party - which seems to completely take over the place...

I was recommended this hotel by a friend and after having browsed the website thought a stay was definitely in order. I was planning a few days over Easter in the Midlands area and trying to coordinate a number of hotels to facilitate a short vacation with the family. Upon looking at their website I spotted a great Easter deal - kids stay and eat free. I emailed reservations twice. No reply even to this day. So I called them to enquire and was told to call back 48 hrs later! Gobsmacked I asked why? I was told they couldn't even tell me if they had any availability so call back. I asked to speak to the duty mgr and 'Aaron' put me on hold, spoke to the duty mgr and advised me again that the mover suggested I call back on Monday. I then asked if I was able to make a booking of any king but surprise surprise - you guessed it. Call back Monday. I have never in my nature life been told by a hotel to call back with no explanation or reason why. No apology. No taking my number and offering to call me back. No response to my email. Clearly they can afford to turn down business where other hotels in the area were more than happy to provide a friendly customer service. Enraged I have even commented on their Facebook page - surprise surprise no response Oh and forget trying to book online. If you have enough patience to navigate the image heavy website which crashes regularly and is non friendly on tablet and iPhone then when you click on their 'children stay free' offer you are only able to book a room for 2 adults!

The foods basic, eat with your fingers fayre but its not about the cuisine its about drinking too much mead & wine and singing along with the cast.

{"User":"Jane B","Cities":16,"text":"This is a beautiful hotel, sympathetically converted with a wonderful attention to detail. It is an exciting, interesting hotel to stay in and explore. We went on a Groupon deal which, even with a £30 supplement for Friday night, was still very good value. Our room, 53, was sumptuous and spacious with patio doors to a lovely courtyard. It was clean and the bathroom was beautifully in keeping with the Abbey decor. We were a little disappointed with the bed which, although large, was very soft and the pillows were also lacking in volume which was not conducive to a perfect sleep. It was very quiet where we were though which, with 3 young boys at home, was a real treat! I had booked a table for 8pm when I booked the room and we confirmed this with reception when we arrived. When we presented at 7:55 the restaurant said our table was booked for 7:30. She made no fuss however and we were shown straight to our table. Whilst this was not an issue it is an example of some of the small niggles with this hotel. We had a lovely meal which I can't fault. We choose from the A La Carte (wood pigeon, scallops, risotto, soufflé and 2 cheese plates). This came to less than the set menu and was good value. The service at dinner was charming and all the staff were keen to make our evening pleasant. However, we sat down at 8pm and did not receive our main courses until after 9pm which we both felt was too long. We were seated in the outer conservatory which was chilly and by the end of the meal I was really quite cold. Being half reptile, so not a good judge of temperature, I confirmed with my husband who agreed the room was pretty cool. I didn't realise until the end of the meal that the other part of the conservatory was much warmer otherwise we would have asked to move. Breakfast was smashing. Lovely fresh fruit, a good selection on the cooked buffet and delicious pastries. Perfect start to the day and all in the warmer part of the conservatory. All in all this is a fabulous hotel with really delightful staff. Everyone we met was welcoming and helpful. We will definitely go back, possibly with the children who would love the adventure of this super building.","title":"\u201cStunning decor\u201d","hotelReviews":4,"location":5,"Reviews":23,"service":4,"value":4,"Location":"Oxford, United Kingdom","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":8,"date":"16 March 2013","sleepQ":0,"rooms":4}

{"User":"TitobenitoDog","Cities":2,"text":"In many ways Coombe Abbey is a fun place to go. The rooms are excellent, although the heating system is a little noisy in the annex block. We were thoroughly looking forward to high tea, which we had been told was available before 5pm. On arrival at 4.30 we were told that we should have booked and that the service was now closed - big disappointment. After some unnecessary fuss, the restaurant were instructed by the management to allow us in. In some ways this reflects the hotel. Whilst the staff were on the whole very friendly, the organisation and management could definitely improve, that way the customer experience would be greatly enhanced. The medieval banquet was great fun however and was only let down by the poor disco at the end. Everyone comes out the banquet in a party atmosphere, only to be let down by the music which was poor. Inevitably the dance floor becomes empty after a few songs and people wander off. Sunday lunch was a bit of a let down also. The food service was slow, and the food not piping hot to everyone's disappointment. In mitigation to the hotel all areas were full due to a wedding and Mothering Sunday. Even so Sunday lunch was very mediocre. Overall some sharpening up on the management side, and slicker organisation with the staff in certain areas, particularly the catering, would greatly improve the whole experience.

This was excellent value as it was a Groupon voucher which would have included a room upgrade and entry to Coventry Cathedral. On arrival, our first impression was that it was very dark but that is something that you soon get used to and after a while you don't even notice it. The decor of the hotel is excellent and very clean. Our room was 217 and could not be faulted but the u.s.p. for this hotel is the staff. Each and every one was superb with a smile on their faces and nothing was too much trouble. The conservatory makes an excellent setting for a romantic meal. We ordered a rib-eye steak (£20) for our evening meal but it was very disappointing. I did complain about the quality and to be fair they dealt with it in a very satisfactory manner. I was offered another one which I declined and they then offered a liqueur coffee at no charge. I feel that it's how a problem is resolved that is the difference between good and bad and this is good. The country park is lovely for an afternoon walk presuming the weather is good. Incidently we did go to Coventry Cathedral and it was worth it even though we had to pay.","title":"\u201cSuperb staff\u201d","hotelReviews":9,"location":4,"Reviews":10,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Wolverhampton","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":4,"date":"15 March 2013","sleepQ":4,"rooms":5}

I got him there on the pretence of going for a country walk, it was a bright sunny day so ideal, so I could get him into the hotel without him realising we were staying, I had booked to have afternoon tea at 3pm. We walked around the country park and had some time to spare, my partner joked that we should see if they did hourly hotel room rates!! I then told him we had got a room overnight, he was a little surprised!! We went to reception to see if we could check in early, check in was at 3pm and it was 1.30pm, but the receptionist said the room wasn't ready (she didn't ask our name or check any rooms???) so we decided to go for a drink in the bar, the service at the bar took a long time, but the drinks when we got them were fine. We then went back at about 2.20pm to see if the room was ready, we saw a different receptionist, and she was lovely, very helpful and welcoming. We were able to get the room key and went off to explore. The room was lovely, very cosy, a view over the moat and park. The bathroom was well lit, a huge bath, ample towels and toiletries. We went for afternoon tea, again the service was poor, we had to wait until 3.40pm for our table, even though we were booked in at 3pm, the afternoon tea once it arrived was adequate, and we were given extra sandwiches. When we spoke to the waiter he said it was a quiet day, so I dread to think how long the wait would be for a busy day. We were booked in for dinner at 8pm but changed it to 9pm as it was late when we finished tea, when we went for dinner we were very disappointed with the lack of choice, the set menu had a choice of three starters and mains but they had run out of a starter and main, we asked to see the a la carte menu, and ordered from that, but when we opted for the lamb wellington we were told that we had been given the previous nights menu, I ordered the venison, which was lovely but my partner ended up ordering fish and chips from the bar menu, not really the fine dining we had expected! We ordered wine and there was a lot of sediment in the glass at the end. The restaurant manager was very pleasant and was embarrassed about the lack of choice saying they had run out of things because they were having an audit the following day...After a good sleep the breakfast was very good, well presented and hot. Overall a pleasant stay, full of character, but the dinner experience put a dampner on the occasion.

{"User":"Suzy B","Cities":0,"text":"We looked around at one or two wedding venues before deciding on Coombe Abbey for our wedding. I have to say that I fell in love with it instantly and the fantastic personal service that was given by Joanne (Wedding sales manager) cemented our decision that Coombe would be the place for us. Coombe is a very busy hotel but Joanne and her team were always on hand to make us feel special and to handle any high maintanence demands I may have thrown at them! The whole run up to the wedding went very smoothly with no hiccups at all. Saturday 2nd March 2013 The day started at 12:30 with our ceremony in the Abbeygate, which looked so pretty, covered in candles and flowers. Our master of cermonies John was fantastic (and efficient) at getting everybody in the right place at the right time. This was followed by bubbles and canopes (of which there were plenty) for all of us to enjoy, outside on the terrace. The weather was absolutely amazing which meant we had some fantastic photos in the grounds of Coombe Abbey. We had a two piece acoustic band playing in the bar of the cloisters to keep the guests entertained whilst we had the last few photos take. The wedding breakfast was in the cloisters which is the most beautiful room and looked amazing with the candelabras and flowers. We had a three course meal, chicken & mushroom terrine, lamb (which was melt in the mouth) and then apple and pear crumble with ice cream, and tea/coffee to finish. It was all served efficiently and most importantly all came out hot and tasty (huge compliments to the chef)!! The waiting staff were young, enthusiatic and friendly and even got me a diet coke to help wash down all the wine! There was a break after the speeches where we went and checked into our room! We decided not to upgrade on the wedding night and i'm glad we didn't as the room was lovely. It had a view over the gardens and lake, a huge four poster bed, turn down service, amazing bathroom with rolltop bath and a bottle of champagne waiting for us! Our evening reception started from 7:30 it consisted of lots of dancing, live music and the highlight fireworks!! They were amazing and definitely worth the bracing cold night to see them! We had sausage and bacon rolls with curly fries in the evening which were very tasty! The only one niggle which we had was they ran out of ketchup during the service...But seriously this is a very minor niggle in a perfect day! We danced our socks off till 1am and then all met for breakfast in our private room (Stuart room) which was set up escpecially for us and our guests. Breakfast was as expected tasty and plentiful. We stayed for a second night, used the complimetary access at Virgin health club for a swim, jacuzzi and sauna, and then went into our upgraded suite in the priory which was AMAZING!! Dinner and breakfast were in the Garden room restaurant and were delicious! We didn't really want to leave on Monday morning but the real world called. All in all I would recommend Coombe Abbey to any couple looking for a magical fairytale wedding. I felt like a princess for the day and everything went so smoothly.

All topped of with mead and wine and a jolly sing song and some mediaeval frivolities, paved the way for a great dining experience that I would highly recommend. I must say though, I would also say it is a must for dressing up. The disco after was a nice end to the evening too with a few local ales on tap at the bar.

Coombe Abbey had probably two or three other events all going on at the same time. It really had the potential to go very wrong. It Didn't. The staff were exemplary, ushering lost guests to where they needed to be and even collecting randomly scattered gifts and taking them to my room all with the minimum of fuss. I'd booked the Medieval banquet for the evening followed by a disco in an adjoining room. All very medieval and authentic (not the music) I'd warned guests not to expect too much from the food as it was all part of the Medieval experience and not meant to be fine dining. I needn't have worried. Despite having to eat with a dagger and fingers it was really very good and certainly plentiful. The rooms were exactly as you would expect from an hotel with the USP of an ancient Abbey and the public areas just oozed character especially at Christmas with all the decorations. I couldn't have asked for a better party and I'm sure it will long be remembered by everyone present. Thanks to everyone at Coombe Abbey. Room Tip: Worth paying the upgrade for a better room.

{"User":"felicity1977","Cities":4,"text":"I booked to say here with my husband as a 'thank you' for our honeymoon. Originally I booked a room through Groupon but decided to upgrade the room to a Grand Feature 1 room. Total cost for the room was £290 B&B. The room was utterly beautiful with our own spiral staircase up to a roll top bath and personal steam room. The room was lavishly decorated, stunning in appearance and finishing touches like the small box of chocolates left on turn down all added to the decadent stay. Breakfast was freshly cooked and tasty. Staff exceptionally friendly, however, was it a £300 stay? I don't think so. If the bill had been £100 less it would have been excellent value. Unlike the nearby Wroxall Abbey, there is no spa or pool which I believe would have justified the £300 room rate.","title":"\u201cStunning location, stunning room with a stunning price!\u201d","hotelReviews":5,"location":5,"Reviews":5,"service":5,"value":3,"Location":"Bedfordshire","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":7,"date":"25 February 2013","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}

The breakfast was plentiful and excellent. Menu for evening meal offered plenty of choice. Beautiful restaurant and ambience and extremely attentive staff. Only criticism is main meal lacked a bit of 'oomph'! Walking around the grounds is wonderful. Had one small problem but we spoke to the duty manager and all sorted. Will definitely be back.

{"User":"Cullenwheeler","Cities":8,"text":"I was given a voucher for Afternoon tea for two as a birthday present.That was back in May last year and I thought I'd best use it before it expired. February probably isn't the best time to appreciate the grounds of Coombe Abbey,but it was still a very impressive building. I had booked my table in January but there was no sign of my reservation on the list.However a table was found for myself and my friend. I was concerned that the Garden conservatory would be a little chilly this time of year,but it was lovely and cosy. Quite a few obvious cobwebs everywhere,nothing a flick round with a feather duster couldn't remedy. We had 3 small sandwiches each,about the width of two fingers,a large scone,jam & cream(would have liked a bit of butter and more cream for two people).A little lemon meringue pie slighty larger than a 50p piece,a bun cut in half,a chocolate sponge cake about 1inch sq. A nice large pot of tea to wash it all down. It wasn't quite what I expected but I was full afterwards.I think I hoped for a dainty,more colourful selection of cakes. Felt a little bit like we were being urged to finish and vacate as once we'd finished our last cake we were given a piece of paper with the code for the exit barrier in the car park.I would have expected this to be given after you'd paid your bill? As a gift it was much appreciated and enjoyed.I would consider visiting again,but would visit during the spring/summer time. Staff were pleasant and helpful.

{"User":"svinge","Cities":0,"text":"After spending nearly 2 days trawling the internet for somewhere different to stay for my Birthday I came across Coombe Abbey \u2013 I am so glad I did, what an absolutely amazing place this is. I only booked it 10 days before we were going to stay and I didn\u2019t have a choice of rooms, so we were booked into the Berkeley (room 167), I booked direct with the hotel and got a cheaper deal than I could anywhere else on the internet. The approach to the hotel is via a small road through Coombe Country Park, with the hotel car park off to the right. The entrance to the hotel itself is over a little bridge over the moat and through a lovely courtyard. When we went through the entrance it certainly gave us the \u201cWOW\u201d factor. If you like 12th century / gothic style then this hotel is definitely for you, it has been restored extremely well and in keeping with the period. I have read some comments on here stating that it is dimly / not very well lit \u2013 I don\u2019t think they had fluorescent lighting in the 12th century! If you want this type of hotel then go to a \u201cchain\u201d hotel where all of the bedrooms are the same. The reception staff were very courteous and helpful and booked us in quickly even though there was a short queue. When we went into \u201cbedchamber\u201d we were blow away, a huge 4 poster bed greeted us with sumptuous \u201c12th century\u201d furnishings. There were lots of little extras - a small decanter of sherry on a silver platter with glasses, a bottle of water and Appletizer, sweets on one of the bedside tables, a platter of fruit with plates, napkins and knives. Lots of tea, coffee and milk as well as hot chocolate, sachets of cappuccino and biscuits. The bathroom was up stairs via a spiral staircase \u2013 again it was beautiful with a roll top bath a separate shower, fluffy bath robes and towels and \u201cCoombe Abbey\u201d embellished slippers. The complimentary toiletries were abundant and very good quality. The 2 very big feather pillows on the bed were lovely, however, this is not a criticism just a comment, as I have feather pillows at home, but it would have been nice if they had pillow protectors on them as well as the pillow cases as the feathers tend to stick out a little and jab in your face at night! We booked the medieval banquet, as there were just the 2 of us were a little apprehensive when we arrived as everyone seemed to be in big parties and dressed up. However, on being shown to our table, we were put with other couples and soon got chatting and made new friends. The evening was awesome, from the food to the ambience / decor of the Abbeygate banqueting hall to the waiting staff and actors who kept us thoroughly entertained throughout our meal. Breakfast was lovely, sitting in the conservatory whilst it was raining and cold outside, with plenty of coffee and toast bought to our table along with a newspaper. So much so we sat there for nearly an hour and a half! The cooked breakfast did not have a huge variety, but was of good quality and tasty. The continental breakfast had lots of variety; fruit, compote, yoghurts, cheese, meat, mixed warm pastries and preserves and different flavoured juices. Well done Coombe Abbey for making our stay an exceptional one, we cannot wait to visit again.","title":"\u201cAbsolutely amazing!\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":1,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Coventry, West Midlands","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"22 February 2013","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}
{"User":"Shropsh","Cities":0,"text":"We arrived at Coombe & took advantage of the half term offer of free upgrade to feature room & children eat free. We had a friendly welcome at reception & i was simply WOW-ed by the character & ambience of the hotel. We stayed in room 209 a beautiful 4 poster feature room. Room was spacious & well equipped. Bathroom & bedroom had furnishings in keeping with the hotel, a lovely old feel. It was a lovely quiet room & spotlessly clean. The bed - Wow! Amazingly comfy & my daughter brought her inflatable bed so no need for extra beds in room. The view was nice, nothing exciting as it was to the rear of hotel, but we were more than pleased. Couldn't fault anything in the rooms, robes in the bathrooms were a lovely touch, tv was a little dated & no Sky TV but this is a old hotel & we didn't come to watch TV, overall really pleased with the room. We'd love a suite next time as they looked the biz :) After unpacking we took a stroll around the gardens & out onto the park. Even this time of year everything was well kept & my little girl adored watching the ducks & swans on the water. We had a lovely walk & then admired the exterior & interior of this beautiful hotel. Lovely ornate corridors, beautifully furnished, it is simply a pleasure to stroll around. It's a dimly lit hotel, so beware light lovers... It's quite dark, It all adds to the ambience & gives the hotel a very relaxed feel. It's perfect for romantics, but my 3 year old enjoyed the experience just as much as we did. There is a play ground & visitors park next to the hotel so younger kids have something to do. It's perfect to bring your kids although there weren't many during our stay. Moving on to dinner, i was slightjy dissapointed with the Table d'hote. The soup & cheese & biscuits were beautiful, but the main was a tiny portion of crusted lamb & my partner had guinea fowl. It was beautiful but the portion sizes were not generous & no vegtables (except the ones that dressed the plate - 3/4 teaspoons of mash & a leafy green like veg.. These dressed the plate & were not supplemented by extra vegtables) extra veg can be ordered at a supplement but we didn't as would have been a 10 minute wait, we weren't asked if we wanted extra veg at the time of ordering so we just presumed it came with the meal. It's just a very deceptive menu. You don't get what you pay for in my opinion. The main meals we saw other guests having looked delicious & better value, on reflection i wish we'd had a main & dessert as opposed to the Table d'hote. Just poor value for money. I don't want to appear negative because the food was lovely, just expected more on the plate for £34.95. In contrast breakfast was a feast!!!! We had ample pain au chocolats, fresh fruit & cereals & a freshly cooked English breakfast, more toast & coffee were ordered & nothing was too much trouble, breakfast was supberb!!! Service in the hotel was top class, both for the restaurant & at breakfast. Eaten at alot of fine restaurants & the mannerisms & professional service at Coombe is high up in the ranks. They have seriously got it. From pouring the wine, to taking the orders, they execute it maginifecently. I wouldn't hesitate coming back to dine here. The staff were beyond helpful & extremely professional from check in to check out. Overall a very Fine hotel, beautiful clean rooms that are unique & ornate, very friendly staff & exceptional service. Only criticism Table d'hote, but certainly didn't put me off. Would definatley come back to Coombe ~ a truely gorgeous hotel.","title":"\u201cWow! Beautiful hotel, lovely rooms &amp; 5 star service!

{"User":"andrew g","Cities":2,"text":"we enjoyed another fabulous stay at this amazing hotel for the valentine weekend. We stayed in our favorite section of the hotel , the park priory, and we were ungraded to a grand feature room, we normally book the feature room. This is the perfect hotel to enjoy a relaxing romantic stay at any time of the year. All the rooms are furnished differently, and the whole place is well kept and looked after. Our evening meal was wonderful, on this occasion we dined in the cloisters, which is a bit of a poor choice of name, my wife thought we were being put in the corridor of the old priory because the normal garden restuarant was overfull. In fact the cloisters is a very grand traditional drawing room, with a large fireplace and ornimental ceiling, magnificent. Just to give a bit of critical feedback, hopefully constructive critism, the sunday am breakfast was a little disorganised. The hotel ususally hosts weddings and these guests may breakfast in other parts of the hotel, often the room where they have had their ceromony and night do. As this sunday was part of the busy valentine weekend the other guests either had breakfast in the garden restuarant or the cloisters, we were in the cloisters for our breakfast.The problem was there was no one greeting the guests, as is normal. Several guests waited in the corridor to be seated, unsure what to do. Some may have actually been booked in to breakfast in the other rooms. This for us was a small problem, probabley due to the busy weekend. We will certainley be returning for another great weekend.","title":"\u201canother fabulous stay\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":2,"service":4,"value":4,"Location":"Barnsley, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":1,"date":"21 February 2013","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

The food was delicious, the service was brilliant and the attention to detail was amazing. All staff we came across were very pleasant and helpful despite it being a very busy weekend approaching Christmas and hosting a wedding. Special mention for the staff looking after us in the private dinner on the Friday night for their attentiveness and the way they upheld the element of the 'surprise' for our friend. We really enjoyed the luxury of our room and bathroom - all spotlessly clean and very comfortable and we loved the building itself, its opulence, its quirky and individual rooms and the beautiful setting.

This hotel in an a 12th Century Cistercian Abbey which is beautifully furnished and decorated with many interesting nooks and quiet sitting areas. All the staff without exception where friendly, courteous, efficient and customer service orientated just how it should be. The grounds where lovely to walk around. The breakfast buffet was the best in all the hotels we stayed at. We ate in one night and though the restaurant was fully booked we ate on one of the many tables dotted around the ground floor areas as this hotel has many areas to choose from. The food was good. The ambience of this hotel is lovely. The one problem was the twin beds we had the narrowest ( I have never seen single beds this narrow before) they where the most uncomfortable beds of any hotel we stayed in. Every time you turned over it was with a danger of falling out. My two teenagers in the next room complained and felt exactly the same way and they are tall and thin. We travelled on the night train from Rome to Paris and the beds on the train I would rate as a 1 out of ten, the beds we had at Coombe Abbey I would rate a 2 out of ten. I know not all rooms have these beds, so I would definitely stay at Coombe Abbey again but make sure on checking in that we did not have beds like these. If Coombe Abbey got rid of everyone of these beds, I would rate this hotel ten out of ten. I gave an excellent rating for this hotel due to everything else being perfect and the staff being so great.

Our room was on the ground floor and was truly magnificent, very spacious and had textile wall coverings that matched the bedding and a superb bathroom. The heating has individual controls.

The staff made us feel welcome and nothing was too much trouble. My husband had arranged for chocloate and bubbly to be in the room for when we arrived, it was just perfect. Breakfast was included in the price and was scrummy. We sat in the conservatory, there was a lot of food to choose from if a full english didn't take your fancy.

{"User":"Rhona U","Cities":6,"text":"I and a group of work colleagues had booked some months ago to have the Mediaeval Banquet on Friday 18th January and then we had treated ourselves to the full Coombe Abbey experience by booking 15 rooms to stay overnight. This had been paid for in full in advance and a number of my colleagues were travelling up from Devon and Wales. On the day in question it had, as forecast, snowed very heavily over night and had continued to do so. Worrying about our colleagues' journeys we contacted the hotel several times throughout the morning and were advised that everything was going ahead and that if we did not arrive we would lose all our money. However at 2pm the hotel finally contacted us to say it was cancelled and offering two alternative dates, the 1st or 8th February. We chose the 8th February and felt that, although the hotel had left it more than a little late to cancel (as our colleagues had driven for some 5 hours through the snow to get there) this was a fair exchange. We therefore once again arranged for all our colleagues to travel up to the Midlands in anticipation of a fabulous evening. We contacted the hotel last week to confirm arrangements and again on Tuesday this week and everything seemed fine. Lo and behold, the hotel phoned our office today to say they didn't have enough rooms and was it ok if some of us doubled up in twin rooms and some stayed at a different hotel? Really? It's taken them until today to realise they don't have 13 rooms for tomorrow night which have been paid for in full? They offered alternative accommodation locally and taxi transport but fundamentally this misses the point that we wanted to be together as a group to have the full Coombe Abbey experience and had paid handsomely in advance to have it. We have consequently cancelled our booking opting for a full refund and without exception will never consider visiting Coombe Abbey again. Had I been able, I would have given no stars as we have been let down not once, but twice by this supposedly prestigious hotel.","title":"\u201cInsult to injury\u201d","hotelReviews":3,"location":0,"Reviews":12,"service":0,"value":0,"Location":"Alvechurch, England, United Kingdom","cleanliness":0,"Helpful":2,"date":"7 February 2013","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}

Refirb it instead of building new buildings extending a already large hotel look after what you already have a amazing hotel with history that hasn,t as far as i can see had anything done to it ,apart from extensions, since i got married there 7 years ago.It seems that is what they are all bothered about weddings functions more more rooms fill the place type of attittude.Service is good food as always great but rooms noisy as the plumbing is fawlty towers equivalent heating is full on roasting hot had to leave windows open and the smallest hotel bed i have ever slept on it is only a double and at 5 7 tall my feet were hanging over edge of bed ridiculous . Tiles in en suite needed grouting black empty long gaps loose wall tiles etc everything old and tired looking.I know the theme is oldie worldie asthetically it works until you get up close and its dank and tired.So if you are asking yourself shall i or not stay DO, as it is as they say no ordinary hotel it should be and could be one of the best hotels in the country the people who own it should inject some vvvroom into the place aswell as a few quid and they would have arguably the best most historic hotel in england.","title":"\u201cNeeds refirb\u201d","hotelReviews":9,"location":4,"Reviews":10,"service":4,"value":4,"Location":"aldridge","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":18,"date":"6 February 2013","sleepQ":2,"rooms":3}

{"User":"Steve W","Cities":3,"text":"Please note that this is a review of our Afternoon Tea Experience. Having heard about the venue from friends, we stopped at Coombe Abbey Hotel for Afternoon Tea. The grounds and driveway to the hotel is impressive and parking was not an issue. I really liked the entrance to the hotel (a blend of medieval and Victorian?) it may be a little too dark for some, but I found it really interesting. When in the main Lobby area, I asked a member of staff where afternoon tea is served - explaining that I had made a reservation - and was impressed that the member of staff actually escorted us to the Garden Room Restaurant rather than just point us in the right direction. I was concerned that we were approximately half an hour late and that they were due to stop serving shortly, but was assured that this was not a problem. We were shown to a delightful table set in a wicker booth which was nice and quiet and given the menu. We decided to order the full tea which included tea / coffee (refilled as needed) and a 3 tier plate with home baked scones, cakes, sweets and a selection of sandwiches. Our waitress was friendly and extremely attentive and offered to bring more sandwiches - offer accepted, but proved to be too much to manage after eating everything else! There was a good atmosphere and the other customers appeared to be having a good time - a group of them were purchasing gift vouchers which offered a saving on the advertised price. (Not sure if they're still available, but worth a call to find out) Towards the end of our tea, staff were setting up the tables in the restaurant for the evening service, but we were assured there was no rush and encouraged to take our time. I would very much liked to have stayed at the hotel and will hopefully be able to stay when time permits, but I will definitely call in for tea if I know I am going to be in the area again. All in all, a lovely experience.","title":"\u201cAfternoon Tea Delight\u201d","hotelReviews":3,"location":5,"Reviews":3,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"York, United Kingdom","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":2,"date":"30 January 2013","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}

All of the rooms I have stayed in are a good standard with the caveat that in the height of summer there is no air con in the rooms in the main house, and if you have a 12 foot high window in a SW facing room you will struggle to sleep with the heat. Not something to worry about in January! This time I had one of the rooms overlooking the moat which was really nice. On this visit we ate lunch and dinner twice and the standard of food was surprisingly good for this type of hotel. Breakfast s cooked to order and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only negatives relate to the bar. it is is really small for this size of hotel and they are reluctant to serve even guests after midnight. We were ushered out of the bar by a polite but assertive barman. Although many people may not care about this the only bitter they sell is keg Boddingtons and Flowers, both of which are awful. They really should try harder and start selling one good real ale instead of two bad artificial versions.

The whole place had been covered with a layer of snow and it looked amazing. What was striking is that despite the fact that it was a very snowy Tuesday midweek in January in a rural area, there were nevertheless loads of people at the hotel, lots of conference people but also some independent travellers from Asia and Europe and some locals out for a special night-out. I think that defines the hotel and explains some of the disputes about it... It is a conference hotel that accommodates private clients rather than the other way around. I was given a room in the new section -- extremely spacious, extremely good wi-fi, wonderful high bed. Dinner was a kind of bistro standard done very nicely - 7.5 / 10. Breakfast included fresh cooked breakfast which is becoming more and more rare. I ordered poached eggs and smoked haddock - 10/10. It wasnt speedy but nor was it excessively tardy which was fine by me. Juices were nice but from concentrate, coffee was ok. excellent croissants. Basically this is a 4-star conference hotel with an amazing [of several periods] lobby and public areas.

{"User":"Ben W","Cities":7,"text":"My wife and I stayed at Coombe Abbey for a much needed weekend getaway, we knew the hotel well as this is where 3 years previously we got engaged and we have lunched there on occasion. We were really looking forward to the stay and held this hotel in high regard. Our expectations were set high because a) We got engaged here and have fond memories of Coombe Abbey and b) The service was excellent, they went above and beyond to help me with my surprise proposal... The whole time we were there we never found ourselves wanting for anything. Sadly the memory of this stay will not be as happy as the last... Don't get me wrong, you could do far worse than Coombe Abbey, it is far from shabby or unpleasant in anyway. The room was just as good as before, very comfortable, large, good amenities and the setting is lovely, especially when covered in snow as it was when we were there (we've been in he summer and its just as good too). The food was great and the prices are not unreasonable for the quality. For me though the overall experience was sadly let down by the lack of attention to detail. In my opinion, a hotel stay is about the 'how' as much as the 'what' and as I've said above the 'what' is still very good, the 'how' however just left me feeling wanting on a few occasions this time round. The 1st occasion, which was actually quite funny at the time, was upon entering our room to find two single beds, at first I thought the wife was trying to tell me something...! But no, it transpires that the room had been set up this way the night before and the hotel had 'forgot' to put it back to a double. The reception desk still assumed it was set up as a double when I phoned down to query it as we were sure we had booked a double... To be fair they quickly offered to move us or put the room back together as a double. They did the latter quickly and with no fuss, if that was all that went wrong ('wrong' may be a bit harsh but I cannot think of another term at this time) then I would of happily given a 5 star rating, sadly there was a few more oversights... We had the afternoon tea which in itself was really good, we had to wait for a table to be laid which was fine as we had not booked. The table was laid and yet we were left waiting for another 10-15 minutes after it was laid and with no other customers waiting, we felt a bit lost... Had they forgotten us???, no drinks were offered whilst we waited, again nothing too severe in itself but coupled with the next few events added to feeling let down and a little frustrated. We went for dinner in the restaurant which looks and feels great and has a nice ambience. We were greeted and sat down quickly. As I had my jacket on I was expecting someone to ask me if they could take my coat to hang it up for me...Alas, no, I had to ask someone to take it, they offered to put it on a chair in the corner or put it on the coat hook... I took the coat hook option... Why I was offered to have it put on a chair I'll never know! We both ordered scallops to start and then I had venison and Mrs W had chicken for main. Again the food was superb, the service however... Not bad but just not good either... We felt we were rushed through the 1st two courses (we were offered dessert within 45 mins of ordering drinks, starters and main and eating both courses) in the end we sent the waiter back twice when it came to ordering dessert. We had a complimentary bottle of wine as part of our package deal which was served to us both along with an additional drink that I ordered. We decided we wanted water but the waiting team didn't come back for some time when they did we ordered the water and they subsequently brought it over and poured it. That, other than when they brought the food to the table and cleared, was all we really saw of the waiting team. Our drinks were never filled, we did it ourselves, all the drinks ran out an nobody noticed or thought to offer us any more which we actually really wanted, no staff asked if our meals were ok other than when they served or cleared. - good job they were, but were they to know that?? When it came to the point we were ready for dessert, Mrs W had the chocolate fondant and I had the cheese... Still no offer of drinks despite the wine bottle turned upside down... This was yet another little niggle as I love a glass or two of port with my cheese but there was no mention, good service would dictate you should offer your customers accompaniments... The Fondant was good, very rich and gooey just as it should be. The cheeses were decent although I did think 5 Jacobs crackers for four wedges of cheese was a bit tight, I was trying to have almost a whole wedge to a cracker - a bit too much for me, I would have asked for a couple more crackers (which in itself feels wrong for such an establishment) but again, no waiting staff to be seen... When they came to clear, not ask if we were ok, the lady asked if I didn't like the cheese as I left half a wedge, I said I loved it, I just ran out of crackers, she asked if I wanted more... Bearing in mind I stopped eating due to lack of crackers some 10 mins ago it was a case of too little too late.. Besides I was dying of thirst and just wanted to go to the room where I new I could get a coffee and some water. We had breakfast the following morning which was good, the continental selection is good, the cooked section a little sparse in terms of choice but you won't go hungry. All in all a great hotel sadly on this occasion let down by the lack of attention to detail where the customer experience and service is concerned. I have an emotional attachment to Coombe Abbey for obvious reasons and wonder if due to that fact I wondered if I was being a little harsh so I've checked with Mrs W to see if I was expecting too much... The reply was \"that's how it was, the service wasn't good, it was a lot of money to spend for that\"... Please Coombe Abbey, if you read this, focus on the customer a bit more, just like you used to.","title":"\u201cGood... but lacked attention to detail\u201d","hotelReviews":6,"location":0,"Reviews":13,"service":0,"value":0,"Location":"","cleanliness":0,"Helpful":11,"date":"20 January 2013","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}

{"User":"The_Pavillion","Cities":2,"text":"My husband and I stayed at Coombe Abbey for 1 night in January 2013. We found the staff in the restaurant charming and very attentive. We sat down to dinner at 8.15 and were served promptly. The food was piping hot, well presented and very tasty. We stayed in the restaurant until around 11pm finishing our coffee. We stayed in one of the rooms overlooking the courtyard at the front of the Abbey, looking down the long drive. The weather outside was bitterly cold and I was concerned that the old windows might be draughty, however, the thick full length curtains were superb at blocking any inclement weather and the light from outside. The room was toasty and warm. We both slept soundly until 9.30am and were only woken by our alarm. The room was furnished with a double bed with half canopy with spotlights, 2 bedside tables and lamps. Tea and coffee making facilities, TV, hairdryer and dressing table with armchair and a large wardrobe. The bathroom was elevated and partitioned. A large roll-top bath with shower over was 'outside' of the bathroom whilst the toilet and sink through the door. I took a bath and was amazed to find it filled to the brim with piping hot water within a few minutes. I am 5ft 7\" was able to soak comfortably without being squashed and had the water right up to my neck! Bathrobes and other toiletries were also provided. I note from other reviews on this site that people have commented on the rooms being dark. I found that the spot lamp over the dressing table was perfectly adequate for applying make-up etc and my husband also said the light in the bathroom was also perfect for shaving. When I go away for a romantic break I don't want to be greeted with a clinical glaring florescent strip light in my bedroom, the more gentle light provided by the 8+ ceiling spotlight, upright lamp, and 2 bed lamps was perfect to enjoy the period features of the room whilst also be more than adequate to read, apply make up or shave in.","title":"\u201cLovely stay\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":3,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Coventry","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"16 January 2013","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}
{"User":"Julie081","Cities":21,"text":"My husband and I stayed at this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary using a Groupon voucher. We were upgraded to a feature bedroom (128) which was lovely. It overlooked the entrance of the hotel which has a very nice view from the 2 very large leaded original windows. The room has lovely low lighting which makes it very cosy as does the rest of the hotel. The bathroom is up 3 steps with the actual bath (which is really deep) outside the bathroom on the landing next to the actual room. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were dreadful and very, very uncomfortable. They certainly need replacing. The bed covers were old fashioned sheets and blankets and a very slippy throwover. There is a hot water bottle hanging up on the back of the bathroom door. The room was lovely and warm and the radiator could be adjusted easily to whatever heat you required which was ideal with how cold it was outside. Watching the snow falling through the bedroom windows and it settling outside was a beautiful sight. The grounds of the Abbey are wonderful to stroll around if you are into walking. The hotel itself is wonderful and ideal for a romantic weekend/night away. When we arrived we had booked afternoon tea with a group of freinds. Sadly the afternoon tea in my opinion is overpriced for what we were given at £13.95 per head. If you go for the cheese scones and tea at £7.95 it is in my opinion better value for money. Dinner in the Garden restaurant on the evening was superb. The service and the food were excellent. We also had a bottle of wine included in our Groupon voucher if we dined in the hotel - the Rose wine we were served was lovely. All of the staff were very attentive and professional. The breakfast was very plentiful and tasty too,. I would not hesitate to book and stay again at this lovely hotel but would ask on booking to be given a room with decent pillows.

Nothing was too much trouble, and they went the extra mile to make sure that every little detail was taken care of (and there were a lot of little details!) We were married in the Abbeygate, a room so full of atmosphere. There wasn't a dry eye in the house and our toastmaster James ensured that the day went without a hitch (shame he couldn't do anything about the weather!). He was just brilliant. The location is stunning. We couldn't have asked for a venue with more romance, more narrative, and more character. It had everything we wanted and more. All of our family and friends commented on how fantastic the venue was, and every effort really was made by everyone at Coombe Abbey to make sure it was a day to remember. There were plenty of sore heads and hangover stories the following day as well which is always a good sign! If you are considering having your wedding at Coombe Abbey we really can't recommend it highly enough. We felt in safe hands with our wedding co-ordinator Joanne Evans at the helm. A real pleasure to deal with.

It was a venue close to our hearts as we visited Coombe Park as one of our first dates and so it meant a lot to both of us to return to get married there 3 years on. Our wedding Coordinator was Kelly McGee and right from our first meeting back in January through to the day of the wedding she was there with a smile and a pot of tea ready to answer any questions no matter how big or small. The actual wedding day went by like a dream and without any glitches. We were married in the Cloisters which is a truly stunning room and every detail from the mulled wine and canapés on the West Terrace during the photos to the singer in the private bar in the evening and Christmas tree in the room really made for a special winter wedding. We were one of three weddings happening that day which could make some brides including myself anxious but honestly if I hadn\u2019t of known previously that was the case then I never would have known at all. Each wedding party has their own Master of Ceremony who looks after the whole day from start to finish and ensures every little detail is in order which includes keeping guests happy and separate from the other weddings. We were looked after by Tony who went above and beyond to ensure our day was perfect. The hotel guest rooms are fabulous, we had a Grand Feature Bedchamber which is the largest room I have ever stayed in \u2013 we were informed guests including David Bowie, The Scissors Sisters and Guns and Roses had stayed in our room previously. All of our guests loved their rooms which were a selection of Crown and Feature rooms and the private breakfast set up the following morning complete with candelabras and our floral arrangements was a lovely touch appreciated by all. An absolutely perfect wedding held in a stunning venue and I already miss planning the big day with Kelly. I would get married there again tomorrow if I could.

{"User":"Moonraker2008","Cities":5,"text":"Our daughter and her partner treated us to a night in this hotel along with tickets to the medieval banquet and show. We were very impressed with the magnificence of the building exterior and the grounds. You really step back in time from the moment you turn into the mile long drive to crossing the moat and circling the fountain in front of the hotel entrance. Parking is reserved for hotel clients very close to the hotel but concierge parking is also available. The first thing to greet you is the low lit grandeur of medieval times. To the right of the entrance stands the massive pulpit which you pass by to check in at the reception. The receptionist we met, Hayley, was exemplary throughout our stay. Nothing was too much trouble and appeared effortless. A negative point was a smell in the en-suite when we arrived but someone came up straight away to try and fix this. Apparently the floor needed another wash with a fresh mop. Tea & coffee were hidden away in an old wall cupboard and the wrought iron framed windows gave a regal feel to the view. The medieval banquet was well attended but only about 40% of the 'peasants' dressed in medieval attire. The food was excellent as was the medieval 'music hall type' entertainment. My disappointment here was that the third course was too big for me and I was unable to take the untouched food away with me in a doggie bag (or medieval cloth!!) A country park is also along the drive and includes lots of walks with wildlife and a deer park. Worth looking at the history of the Abbey before you go.

The food was excellent both on the day and for our rehearsal dinner with the wedding party the night before. As my parents and I are all vegetarian, this was particularly appreciated as sometimes the veggie food at other weddings I have been to has been a bit of a let down.

I had two joining rooms for me and my bridesmaids to stay in the night before and to get ready in the morning, and the suite that my husband and I stayed on the wedding night was amazing.

We have never had a bad room all the times we have stayed here, until now. The room had a double bed pushed into a corner so there was only access on one side ! No wardrobe, just 3 hangers on a coat peg. The room was so cold and smelled fusty & damp.

There was a wedding reception on and the hotel was full, my objection is that guests of the reception get REDUCED price rooms, yet FULL paying guests are given inferior rooms. I spent many years in hotel management and priority should ALWAYS be given to full rate paying guests....not on this occasion ! Happily this situation was resolved with little fuss. We experienced the same experience at breakfast as on previous stays.....AWFUL buffet style breakfast, unappetising bacon and sausages with watery scrambled egg.

We stayed in the newer wing which is adjacent to the hotel. The room was large and well equipped though the lighting could be better. I have two negative comments, this is why its not 5 star, first the heating is controlled by a warm air flow system, no radiators and despite trying to increase the temperature I never really made it much warmer. The second applies to the shower temperature; despite having a lovely huge overhead shower the temperature was only Luke warm again to adjustment to temperature or shower pressure made the water warmer.

All of the staff from receptionists to cleaners to management to wedding planners can't do enough for you. the preparation was flawless and our wedding coordinator Katie just did absolutley everything for me. When Katie wasnt there the other two wedding planners seemed to know exactly who i was and everything about my wedding. To say they are organised is a huge understatement! All of the bedrooms are just perfect -the most basic rooms are even out of this world. I dont know where to start with the food! We had lamb and i didnt even know you could get that much meat on a lamb!! everyone was amazed by our day i really cant describe how perfect it was! we're still very much on a high still now. We didnt want to leave, so much so that we even stayed an extra night. we had a tex-mex evening buffet because i thought it would be small finger foods and just really some nibbles... Once again outstanded by Coombe Abbey! -It was huge ribs and full stuffed potatoes to name a couple! would definatley recomend that evening buffet! All our evening guests said they'd never seen a wedding buffet like it. (you'd be happy with the evening food for your main wedding breakfast). Only downside of getting married here is that you may not get invited to another wedding again because no one will top this!!! I dont feel im doing Coombe Abbey enough justice, i just dont know what to say. Flawless, exceptional service and EVERY member of staff with no exception acts as if they're your personal butler.

{"User":"Chrissy P","Cities":5,"text":"We stayed at Coombe Abbey over Easter weekend, 2012 with our two nieces, aged 16. This was their first trip abroad, and the experience to be memorable. Coombe Abbey kept the hits coming: The long, tree-lined driveway, the moat, the fantastic lobby...it just kept getting better and better. I dropped off the ladies at the front door and parked the car while they tended to check-in duties. I heard no complaints about the front desk staff. Other reviewers commented about the parking situation, but I found it to be no big deal. Yes, it was crowded, and yes is was a short hike from the car to the hotel, but this isn't Holiday Inn Express, so move on! (I did not observe any suspicious people loitering in the area, either.) We were placed in a room called the \"Dudley Suite\" in an annex building behind the main house. The rooms were full of character and comfort. The suite included a huge, super comfortable bed, dozens of pillows, rich and old looking furnishings, and a second level bathing area accessed by a spiral staircase. The adjoining room offered similar comfort. Reaching for a complaint, I'd say it was a bit annoying that the door between the suite and adjoining room was locked, and we had to wait a bit for the staff to come around with a key. Then, the door would not stay open. We were told it was a code requirement. Okay. When we reserved the rooms, we also reserved seating for the Medieval and murder mystery dinners. My wife and I had a great time at both dinners. The food was great, the shows were amusing, and the atmosphere was spot on. Our nieces were a bit less satisfied with the Medieval dinner. I think they found it embarassing to see the slightly racy show with their adult aunt & uncle. The murder mystery was a better experience for them. Overall, our stay was a memorable experience, and we would (and have,) recommend Coombe Abbey to anyone traveling to England! Room Tip: Ask for the Dudley Suite!

What an excellent choose from the moment we drove down the long drive and then crossed the moat to be greeted by friendly staff in a venue steeped with history. Our room was 'different' and certainly had character, a great change from modern rooms, with the large corner bath/shower being up three steps and seemed more like a stage. All the usual facilities including tea making, satellite TV and free hi-fi, plus a large comfortable bed and good heating. The Public Areas have to be seen to be appreciated and, together with the grounds, need exploring. The Banquet was most enjoyable, we could have chosen the Ball or the meal all happening at the same time, with many guest in period costume. Excellent breakfast including a celebration glass of champagne. One minor complaint a pot of tea for two at £6.00, on arrival, would have expected a biscuit. Fitness centre available but not on site.

{"User":"Pete W","Cities":6,"text":"Myself, my partner and several friends spent the night here recently for a murder mystery night and were all left over the moon with the time spent here. Check in was at 3pm so we phoned ahead and were able to use the facilities at a local virgin spa free of charge as guests of the hotel. Once we arrived at the spa our details had already been forwarded by hotel reception so we could enter without hassle. We were extremely grateful for this and seemed great value for money as it cost is no extra to the room price. The hotel it's self is outstanding, set in and around an old abbey the entire decor follows suit, filled with historical decorations and curiosities. Me and my partner even took the time to walk around the hotel to find its hidden treasures. Check-in was quick and easy and our room was beautiful, huge bed, lots of storage (some very expensive furniture), flat screen TV a large bathroom, everything you could could need. The restaurant at lunch did fairly typical bar food but did it well, service was quick though prices were a little high but you pay for quality. On the evening we attended a murder mystery night which was good fun (providing you're not expecting Hollywood acting), the provided meal was great with great service as usual, the murder mystery characters would come and speak to you during your meal and allow you to ask questions to try and work out who the culprit was. I highly recommend a stay here, especially for couples. It must be one if the best hotels in the UK.

The view of the hotel as you come down the driveway is totally awe-inspiring and once inside the delights continue. Yes it's a bit dark inside, but that adds to the appeal rather than distracts from it. If enough light in public areas is your requirement then book one of the many Premier Inns that are in the area. Every member of staff that we came into contact with was a delight to speak to and the food was excellent. You were given the feeling that this was the only wedding anyone at the hotel had ever dealt with - which is a real compliment for somewhere that must do hundreds each year.

I had told my partner I didn't want to go far so as to keep all family and friends happy and he didn't disappoint me finding such an amazing place to stay only 45 minutes drive from home. We had both previously visited Coombe Abbey for a meal and also on work events but had never stayed there together. My partner booked us in to room 139 which is amazing, Chinese themed with a raised bed and also rolled top bath in the main room, the loo and wash basin being downstairs. Everything was perfect, we had dinner in the restaurant twice and sat in the private corner table. The dining room staff were amazing and nothing was too much trouble and the food was excellent. Breakfast is fine, not excellent just fine, the cold buffet is very good but a bit let down by the hot but then again after all I ate over the two days probably is a blessing in disguise. We were kept entertained at breakfast by listening to the 'coprporates' on their free work do's who made us laugh with their ridiculous talk but it was entertaining as we have been there seen it and done that! We had a great walk around the grounds on my actual birthday and despite the rain it was wonderful, we even had a coffee in the visitors centre and we were made to feel so welcome that we will return with family for Sunday afternoon picnic in the Summer.

The function rooms are very well presented and the staff on hand were excellent - very attentive, friendly and polite. The food we had was a Xmas menu and again was very good quality and served excellently. The overnight room we had also was quite amazing. It was in the newer part of the hotel and we were kindly walked to our room by a porter who again was very friendly (and didn't expect a tip!). Inside the room, the ceiling must have been 20 feet high. The bed was so tall you almost needed a ladder and very comfortable. There was the usual tea/coffee making facilities and free wifi. The best part I thought was the shower though - a massive monsoon shower head coming out of the ceiling (a lowered ceiling in the bathroom), that was as wide as my shoulders and had very good pressure.

On arrival early evening the Abbey looked magical it is truly a magical place and looks stunning. Regretfully I was disappointed with my room. The top of the television cabinet was sticky and all marked where previous occupants had used it to make drinks on. Being on the ground floor (room 5) we had to draw the curtains and to do this we had to move the sofa which had a loose arm and the carpet behind it obviously hadn't seen the hoover for a while. The roll top bath was amazing however, the original plug had been replaced and didn't quite fit and you could hear the water escaping down the hole. Some of the floor tiles were cracked and needed a little t.l.c The bed was comfy the only niggle being could have done with an extra blanket. The bar area was light and airy, and the drinks were a very reasonable price considering it is a hotel. I was really looking forward to breakfast and to be fair on the continental side it was impressive. However for a hotel of this rating I didn't expect to be offered tinned mushrooms. None of the food was salted including the butter which lead to breakfast being utterly tasteless. I paid £149 on a late deal for this room and apparently saved myself £80. Would I visit again ?

{"User":"Mike P","Cities":5,"text":"Stayed for one night on one of Coombe Abbey's special romantic weekends that included champagne, chocolates and flowers, dinner, bed and breakfast in a 'feature double', with complimentary use of spa. Highlights include the mediaeval quality of the main hotel and reception area and the a la carte restaurant menu, although this was extra to the dinner included in the package. To be fair you only pay the difference between a la carte and table d'hote so still good value. Lowlights included no champagne on arrival (which we were promised would be waiting in the room), then had to chase twice before it eventually arrived 45 minutes later. The flowers comprised a modest bunch and the chocolates were less than modest, almost imperceptible. We stayed in the annex which although nicely themed, was an outdoor walk away from the main hotel. My wife was less than impressed that having dressed for dinner, she was exposed to the cold, wind and rain before getting back inside for dinner. Dinner was however, very good, unlike the breakfast which was poor. Top tip, ask the chef for fried or poached eggs on arrival, then you won't have to suffer the mass produced re-constituted scrambled eggs on the buffet table. For a hotel of this quality, I really would have expected cooked to order breakfasts rather than a sub-standard buffet that couldn't even offer a grilled tomato. As for the spa, turns out it was a 5-10 minute drive away - really couldn't be bothered with getting back in the car. One final point, virtually no mobile phone signal at the hotel, although free wi-fi was available. Overall, much was promised, some was delivered, but too much was left wanting for over £300 per night. A classic case of defeat being snatched from the jaws of victory.

{"User":"UttoxeterPedro","Cities":14,"text":"A day-time meeting, a mediaeval banquet and an overnight stay. The meeting rooms are suitably musty and quaint, yet have modern amenities. The buffet lunch was superb. The banquet was a surpirse to some of the team who couldn't grasp the concept of eating with their fingers, but once they joined in the bawdy fun, they loved it. The singers were ok - one young lady with a lovely voice stood head and shoulders above the rest. They all worked hard and were completely in character even when talking to us \"off camera\". The food was excellent - and plentiful. The bedrooms are all lovely - despite the old-fashioned decor, everything worked perfectly. The ambiance of the whole hotel is carefully controlled with low lighting and period piped music. Finally. my lady colleague asked one of the porters to help her move luggage from her room to her car. He pointed out that her car would be iced up and she would freeze while she de-iced it. So without bidding, he took her car keys and went and did the job for her, then stayed with the car while it warmed up and drove it from the car park to reception where he locked it and THEN went to her room for the bags. That was typical of the service I saw while I was there. Room Tip: All rooms are character rooms, but pay a little extra and ask for a good one. You'll enjoy the e...

We stayed in a feature room, which was a beautiful 4 poster bed, decorated in true medieval splendor. We took our 2 children who loved the play area and adventure playground in the forest. To be honest the hotel isnt set up for children and quite rightly most people come to get way from them! We fed ours early and then put them to bed, used the hotel recommended babysitter (who was fabulous and came very well qualified) and had a wonderful experience in the medieval banquet. We didnt dress up but next time i definately will! As a couple they put us on a table with other couples, whcih was great for mixing and socialising and put the larger groups together. The entertainment was great and the food very tasty- dont expect a 'fine dining' experience this was meant to be a medieval banquet and it didnt disapoint. The red wine was ok and the mead drinkable, we could have as much as we wanted if you wanted to ask the waitresses. We didnt stay for the late disco but wanted to get back to the kids but had a memorable night- one which we will be repeating! I would highly recommend this hotel and the banquet.

We personally choose hotels that are very contemporary or boutiquey in their style and would normally avoid such a hotel but are extremely glad that my work do was held here to enable us to enjoy the facilities. The hotel is set in beautiful grounds which we did not explore due to the freezing cold (the moat was frozen over!!) and, as all have said, is gorgeous to look at - the main building is very old and the low lighting adds to the atmosphere. We arrived at 2.30pm so were unable to check in immediately and spent half an hour with a lovely pot of tea, supplied with biscuits, in the bar area. All staff we encountered were very polite and helpful throughout our stay. Just before three we made our way to the new wing to our standard room 163 to find our luggage in situ. The room was decorated in an olde world style which we loved with beautiful touches throughout - the towels were the thickest and fluffiest we have ever encountered in a hotel and all fixtures and fittings appeared to be of a really high quality. Our Xmas party meal was very good with a lovely main course and cheese plate of a much higher standard than is usually found at these type of functions! It was rather chaotic as unfortunately we had all been seated away from our own partners so chose to ignore the place settings - as a party of twenty this didn't help the wait staff when delivering the food but the long table meant that the hotel's own plans would have meant us being well out of touch with our loved ones which seemed wrong. The hotel was very busy with weddings, banquets and Xmas parties but it was all extremely well organised and whilst we feared that breakfast would be a scrum it was the opposite and extremely relaxed being overseen by the maitre'd with great staff arranging drinks and toast - fabulously large tea pots and a wide selection of hot and cold buffet. The hotel has shown us a new style of hotel which we thoroughly enjoyed and our plan is to return for a romantic break next year.","title":"\u201cBeautiful old world charm with very high standards\u201d","hotelReviews":21,"location":5,"Reviews":23,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Bristol, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":62,"date":"2 December 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":5}

The entrance courtyard, moat and ancient buildings restore the period atmosphere only as far as the hotel reception which frankly is dimly lit Disney.Our standard double room is however lovely with canopied bed, lounge area and big bathroom complete with iron tub bath although again weirdly dark and shadowy!

For a 119 room 5 star hotel the bar is a disgrace with no table service, no real ales and nowhere to sit. The felony was compounded, following a long wait, by being given short measure of spirits (no optics) and white wine in a dishwasher hot glass and no apology. We eventually found our way to an outbuilding where we were seated shoulder to shoulder on hard benches to discover the \"4 course feast with wine\" was in fact tinned soup, a single pork rib, a chicken quarter with baked spud and synthetic apple pie with ice cream. The red wine was battery acid style and the meed not unlike a sample awaiting testing. The entertainers whilst doing there utmost were straight out of a pantomime albeit the audience catchphrase was \"Hosannah\" rather the \"Ho-de Ho\". Having expected suckling pig in front of a roaring fire, with jugs of wine and mediaeval music, we left very disappointed avoiding the 80's disco next door. Breakfast, inevitably was service-free buffet style with the seemingly compulsory pile of bangers, sheets of bacon stuck together and a brick of watery scrambled eggs. I suppose in the high volume hotel/liesure industry, service levels have to suffer in favour of profitability, but a visible and obliging Maitre de circulating amongst his guests (and staff) putting these irksome issue right would be a good first step in the right direction.","title":"\u201cJust too corporate for comfort.....\u201d","hotelReviews":18,"location":5,"Reviews":30,"service":2,"value":2,"Location":"Cambridgeshire","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":40,"date":"19 November 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

We were looked after by our Master of Ceremonies, Jon all day/evening and he ensured that everything ran to plan. Considering the numbers attending, the wedding breakfast was delivered without delay so that all tables were eating the same courses at the same time, and the food was fantastic.

All guests were impressed with the venue and food. And all family members felt in awe of this venue, so much so we are still talking about it 3 days later. Highly recommend the Lady Craven suite - very romantic. Very apt for a wedding night. We have already booked for our first wedding anniversary. Despite having another 3 functions on at the same time as our wedding we did not at all feel that we did not matter - the service received was not compromised and we felt so important at all times.

When I first got got there I was not that impressed. The signs in the carpark are not very good and if you park in the wrong place you cant see where the reception is. However, walk towards the court yard and you are met by idyllic surroundings. So impressed was I that I found myself stopping to photograph the moat..... In the rain......... Beleive me the setting certainly made up for the lack of signs and the fact that I walked around the building a little more than I needed to was a benefit not a hinderence. (Valet Parking is available if you drive into the courtyard) When you find the sign for the reception and head up to the door and on opening you are met by a series of gothic arches, and an impressive oak veneer. Once again reach for the camara, stop look around, amazing. At first I thought my room was a little dark, but somehow it befits the atmosphere of the place. gothic architecture, deep heavy curtains, classic decor. As for the food truly superb, an excellent menu well presented. The qality and service.... Superb, the staff make eye contact and smile even when walking down the corridor, they seem eager to please. One tiny issue I did note was the bathroom had a fitting missing (Room 120). As a result there were two screw heads sticking out of the tiles and on the base of the bath hand rail, some paint has flaked due to corrosion. The faults are really trivial and insignificant and normally I would not have noticed this but when you have such an amazing product and such helpful staff, somehow these tiny issues are magnified.

When we arrived the receptionist was ever so friendly and very helpful indeed, We had our car parked by valet and where taken to our room by a very friendly member of staff. We where given a room, it was stunning, once we got in there was a bit chilly, we tried to set the heating but the display panel had been smashed therefore could not see the temperature my husband called reception and they sent someone down with a heater. We went to dinner and i cant fault them for anything, I have food allergy's and there where more than helpful and went above and beyond exceptional service in my eyes. Once back to our room was still cold so called reception and they moved us to another room without question. This was smaller not as grand but still very pretty. Breakfast was excellent again catered for my allergy and made me feel very normal and just like anyone else. Me and my husband intend to return here every year for our anniversary's ( Well i hope so ) Only downside was the heating issue otherwise a excellent stay. Room Tip: Ask for a room in the Priory !

Discovered one secret though: surprisingly our enjoyment has been inversely related to the room type (and the price paid)! Stayed in the cheapest room and we were rewarded with plenty of natural light, decent furnishings, a nice view and still adequately spacious and cosy. Our first stay, in the Netherfield suite, was the opposite: awkward use of space, naff view over outbuildings, cold, and way over the top camp décor that bordered on the kitsch with the only saving grace of a lovely slipper bath and double shower room. Last year stayed in a \u2018featured bedchamber\u2019 that was OK but very dark and trying to have a shower in the roll-top bath was a pain. Also ditched the so-called \u2018romantic package\u2019 that consisted of cheap champers, an awful flower arrangement and a few chocs and spent the money instead on a lovely a la carte dinner and a bottle of Veuve Clicquot (which I think outshines Bolly everytime).

We were in the newer section, Priory House, however the rooms were just as decadent as in the main building. The power shower was wonderful, although the en-suite would have benefitted from a window- as would all hotel en-suites. The surroundings were fabulous and we enjoyed a walk around the country park as well. We also had the table d'hôte menu for half price, which was fair but in no way worth the full price of £69. The service in the restaurant was shambolic but friendly, the waitress and waiter getting both our wine and main mixed up. The after dinner brandy in the library was simply elegance itself!

{"User":"Spongegod","Cities":69,"text":"You will read many reviews here saying different things, whatever they say this hotel is definitely worth staying at. The car park is a short walk from the main hotel entrance but disabled parking is available immediately outside the door. The car park is free for residents. It's important to note that Coombe Abbry is situated within Coombe Park, this is a public park but is do extensive that you don't see that many people and \" walkers \" etc do not have immediate access to the hotel. Check in was smooth, the receptionist was efficient if not a little too efficient, ( lack of interaction). Our room- a feature double was very plush. A big four poster dominated the room and contrary to other reports was very comfy and provided a wonderful nights sleep. Yes the room( and most of the hotel) are dimly lit or as I would prefer to call it \" mood lighting\". For me this helps maintain the ambience and aura of the hotel. If you had this place lit up like Blackpool it would kill it. Hot drinks, digital tv and free wi-fi are all available in the rooms as are toiletries. I agree with others, a small complimentary bottle of water would be a very nice touch and maybe this is something the hotel could consider. Some people have said the room should have a fridge..I stay at many hotels and very few have fridges in the room so do not see the lack of one a real problem. Coombe Abbey is an experience, enjoy the moment and have room service..cool drinks can be brought up to you and ours arrived within minutes of ordering,( there is a small surcharge). The actual bar area is a little small and can only really accommodate around 6-8 guests but there are plenty of other tables in the main hall area that can be used. The conservatory restaurant is very nice and differs greatly in ambience and style from day to night. We ate in there in the evening and were lucky enough to have one of the \"birdcages\" in the corner. It's quite bizarre but added to our experience. The food quality was very good. All of it was well presented and served with good service. Between us we had scallops, rib eye steak, monkfish. The scallops weren't aplenty but had a deep flavour and were cooked to perfection. The same was true of the steak, cooked as requested seved with \" fat chips\". The house Merlot is of a good level and if memory serves me right so was the Malbec we had with the meal. Tea and brandy rounded off a nice evening before retiring to our lovely four poster. Breakfast offers a wide selection of continental fayre- cereals, cheeses, meats cakes. And then is supplemented with a choice of hot food. This varies from full english( both meat or veg option) / smoked fish/ eggs benedict and some more to boot. All in all we found the food to be as it had been the night before, well cooked and presented with good taste. Checkout was a different experience to check in. The lady was very chatty and friendly telling us all about the ghosts that are rumoured to live there. I would definitely return as this is a lovely hotel and the staff, facilities are very difficult to beat. Yes it is expensive but you get what you pay for. The website shows various offers and from time to time you can get a real bargain so keep checking. Finally, the hotel does offer medieval banquets -weddings- party nights- afternoon tea. All those details are available via the website.","title":"\u201cWonderful venue...want to return\u201d","hotelReviews":82,"location":0,"Reviews":116,"service":0,"value":0,"Location":"Leeds, United Kingdom","cleanliness":0,"Helpful":109,"date":"25 October 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}

My Husband, myself and 2 friends booked a feature room per couple & Medieval Banquet on Oct 20th. On entering the hotel the character was evident everywhere and myself & party were very impressed. A mixture of stone arches, ornate carvings and atmospheric lighting greeted us. The friendly staff directed us to our rooms, room 141 very pleasing and comfortable to our friends & the Princess Elizabeth suite for myself and Husband. It is beautifully decorated, with private bathroom up a quirky little staircase, wonderful looking bed & lovely views across the moat. Fresh fruit & sherry was waiting to refresh us. The Medieval Banquet was very well organised and I was impressed by the amount of people who embraced the spirit & dressed in medieval costume - about 85% of 150 people! The food provided was simple fayre but tasty and well presented on authentic glazed pottery ware. It was well accompanied by mead & red wine. The entertainment was just that - entertaining, funny and well timed in between courses. The after show disco was really good and a lovely end to the evening. excellent value for money! The following morning I was expecting (after previous trip advisor comments) to not have such a good experience with breakfast, WRONG! We arrived at 9.10am at peak time. We were almost immediately seated even though the hotel was full. The dining room was very pretty & clean with lots of interesting things to look at. The breakfast itself was varied & catered for all tastes including fresh fruit, pastries, cheeses, cereals & cooked breakfast, It was well presented and the cooked breakfast was hot & tasty. Checking out was swift & easy. Afterwards we stayed for a further hour or so for an impromptu tour of some of the historical rooms & stories about the colourful characters that played their part in Coombe Abbey's history by the delightful Duty Manager, Tony.(please write a book!)

{"User":"Justine M","Cities":4,"text":"My husband and I went there for our anniversary the weekend of the 22nd September, and stayed for 2 nights. The first thing I noticed, was that the grounds were crawling with families, because the council bought the land for the local community, which although didn't detract from the place, is something to be aware of. Also the car park is some distance from the hotel, which isn't so great in the rain. My husband booked an upgraded room with champagne, flowers and chocolates. Although the room was lovely, I couldn't see much between our room and the regular rooms shown on the Internet, although we did face on to the courtyard! Unfortunately my husband was Ill throughout our stay, and one thing I noticed, was that there is literally nothing to do! There is very little space to hangout, other than your room, so by the end of the 2 nights, I had cabin fever!! Also, there is no mini fridge in the room, and on arrival only hot drinks facilities, which was fine for me, but my husband only drinks cold drinks. I felt that for the best part of £600, a complimentary bottle of water might've been included! Also, except for at breakfast, you don't get drinks with your meal, and they work out fairly expensive. Meals are in the conservatory, which although lovely to look at, was very chilly, so take a cardigan! Overall, if you were to go with a group, or were to be there on a corporate event, I think the atmosphere would be fun, but as a lone traveller, I wouldn't recommend it. I also agreed with another writer who felt that the designer had gone a bit OTT with the gothic decor, and despite arriving on a lovely sunny day, it was gloomy inside. All in all, for the money we paid, I'd rather have gone to Warners, at least I'd have had something to do!","title":"\u201cBeautiful to look at, but nothing to do!\u201d","hotelReviews":4,"location":3,"Reviews":4,"service":5,"value":3,"Location":"Reading, United Kingdom","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":15,"date":"8 October 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":4}
{"User":"king_of_muffins","Cities":41,"text":"Spent two days (one night) here on business. First impressions are excellent, as you approach up the long driveway. The abbey is a really stunning building and it continues to impress once inside. With some great use of low level lighting, which picks out certain architectural features, there is a real sense of atmosphere and drama when you arrive in reception. My room was in the main abbey building and was furnished in a period style; with delightful antique furniture and dark colours. The antique wc with chain was charming, an old writting desk notable and the bed comfortable. Elsewhere, the grounds are extensive, varied and pleasant; with woodlands, well kept gardens, parkland and a lake. One of the larger conference rooms we used was in a more modern part of the hotel and was pleasant. On the second day we used a grandly appointed room for a smaller meeting in the old part; which was impressive, with a beautifully detailed ceiling and large ornate fireplace. Food served by the hotel was of a good standard and the restaurant was pretty in the evening and light and airy by day. Could anything be improved upon? Well, the main shower over the bath was weak, however the brass mixer taps had a shower head as well and that was powerful and hot, so no problem there. There were no leisure facilities on site, despite the vast grounds; guests have access to a Virgin Active 10 minutes away. But the grounds made for an excellent running course; far better than a treadmill! Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel. It would make a great romantic getaway, provides a fabulous backdrop for big events and was great for a work conference; with good facilities and fantastic grounds for team building activities.","title":"\u201cLovely, atmospheric, hotel.\u201d","hotelReviews":49,"location":5,"Reviews":53,"service":4,"value":4,"Location":"uk","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":36,"date":"7 October 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}

I went there with 6 other family and girlfriends for a Hen Weekend. We attended the Medieval Banquet, in costume. Check-in got very confusing, partly because rooms weren't ready, and the computer system kept failing. Also, my sister had booked 3 twin rooms and one single, which all turned out to be doubles. One was quite a small double and wasnt really appropriate for our needs. To be fair to the check-in staff (especially Hayley - 'Hello') they did handle it well and eventually got us all sorted. For us this was not a problem because we were there to have a fun weekend but I could see that for some this may be frustrating. The banquet was bit noisy, possibly becuase we were all left waiting around in the bar area for quite a while, so a lot of alcohol drunk. We were sat at one end, furthest away and sound system wasnt very good so most of the time we could not hear what was happening on the little stage. We just laughed when everyone else did to join in ! The food was what you expect at a Medieval Banquet - very basic, but the novelty is in eating without cutlery and in the dark candle light. The disco after the banquet was a great idea, and alllows you to extend the evening. Having said all that about the banquet, we all had a great time.

I found out later that the hotel is run by Coventry Council and it then became apparent why, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry\u201d is so easily said. My receptionist was very pleasant and pleased to satisfy our needs but request follow-up was not performed. Issues that reduced the pleasure of our stay; On the first morning, we were disturbed 3 times before 10:30 by the service staff, the first time being 09:20 No eye contact with guests and hence no staff activity when beckoned Wine list cover was in a shabby state Menus were covered with grease marks Bar tables were not cleaned properly A member of staff brushed me with his coat and gave no apology Ice buckets placed where they could not be reached I had to fill our wine glasses even when the waiter was there delivering the food Electrical equipment was not tested for effectiveness Room temperatures were not monitored prior to and during our stay Requests had to be asked twice for any action to be taken Previous occupant's tie was still in the room after we had finally left the room Food was not presented well and some dishes were just ordinary to tasteless Conclusion \u2013 I will not stay again and the hotel management do not appear to understand what is meant by \u201cservice\u201d. The hotel appears to be living on reputation and lack of service quality will bring it down.

Decided to take option of a special Friday evening DBB offer - Glad we did. The afternoon tea was excellent - small cost but treated as though we had paid the earth. Coombe Abbey is some special hotel - very atmospheric and the meals were excellent. The room we stayed in was on the dark side as the theme is in keeping with it's age (no reading of long novels etc). The Grounds and surrounding country park were impressive. Several events were taking place at the same time but the siting of these removed any noise disturbance in the main hotel building.

Room well furnished, clean and good quality, but dark. Bathroom great - shower even greater! Breakfast and evening meal taken in the conservatory - very good, with excellent selection of fresh foods and choice. Service was very good.

Inside is very dark with an almost eerie feel to it - you can imagine the monks floating around in their long robes in days gone by. It is a labyrinth of rooms and passage ways with seating areas, bars and meeting rooms. Overall our stay was good, the room was as you would expect for this calibre of hotel and the breakfast was very good. There were a few minor critisisms - one shower cap for a double room, the mirror in the bathroom is too high for anyone under 5'4\" the makeup mirror is in an awkward place with poor lighting, no bin liners and a bit stingy with the biscuits. We found the staff very professional and helpful especially David. We went to the medievel banquet in the evening which was carried out very successfully by 6 enthusiastic performers. The food was not great, soup, pork rib chop in sauce, chicken in the same sauce with a baked potato & salad and an apple crumble.

{"User":"StuRob A","Cities":8,"text":"Myself and my partner attended a friends wedding reception here and I have to say I was disappointed. After some confusion on arrival as to where to go the reception people were quite abrupt and only knew the newleyweds by their first names but instead of asking for Christian names they just kept saying \"names\" they could have said what are their Christian names because I just kept saying Mr & Mrs ......... ! (there were 4 weddings here on the day) we were directed to the allocated area only to find we had arrived before the bride and groom but no one had told us this, we were given champagne and asked to wait in the garden only to find we were the only people there so had to sneak back out again and re - enter so we could be greeted by the newlyweds, quite embarrassing! The place itself is very beautiful however the rooms are very small, I would say claustrophobic when everyone was seated for the meal. The main disappointment for me was the service, the food was amazing but someone on our table got left out of every course (not the same person each time) and we had to wait some considerable time for the forgotten food to arrive making everyone else's on the table cold by the time we got to eat! As I say this happened on every course. The young girl that served us champagne had never done it before and had to take direction from one of the guests on how to pour or we would have been there all day (she was quite embarrassed which made us uncomfortable). I have been to 6 weddings this year and I must say this location won hands down however the service was very very poor and did ruin it for me but as you do for the happy couple we just made light of the bad situations we kept finding ourselves in. I would say for such a highly rated venue this is unforgivable if It were my wedding I would be having a serious talk with the manager I know it cost a pretty penny to hold the reception here and personally would have expected more.","title":"\u201cDisappointed\u201d","hotelReviews":4,"location":5,"Reviews":12,"service":1,"value":0,"Location":"Northampton, United Kingdom","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":4,"date":"19 September 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":3}

{"User":"mavthepav","Cities":17,"text":"Booked Coombe Abbey for an overnight stay for my Husbands birthday. The grounds are undeniable beautiful, the interior rustic and medieval. We booked into the Johnson Bedchamber which is one of the feature rooms. I was initially a bit disheartened when I realised that our room was in the new part of the building but the room was exquisite, We took the opportunity to do a walk of the grounds a 2.5 mile walk which was lovely, well recommended. Now on to the part of the stay that has caused me to rate this as a 3star. We booked into the garden terrace restaurant and on arrival the Maître D looked us up and down as if to say we weren\u2019t good enough to be there, despite the fact we were both dressed smartly. We had paid good money to be there, I didn\u2019t expect to be looked down on in such a way. Things didn\u2019t overly pick up, despite being looked down on and made to feel we were not good enough to be there the staff still managed to mess up my order and then try and charge me for the food I never received. The breakfast buffet selection was poor; I honestly believe you have more options at a travel lodge, not what you would expect for the standard of the hotel. On conclusion \u2013 A lovely hotel with beautiful grounds, I get the impression they try and cram too many events and guests in at one go with not enough staff to manage it. I would say if you want a hotel for this price range with lovely grounds and traditional interior book in to Ettington Park Hotel They have better service and equally good grounds with the added bonus of a spa for the same price.","title":"\u201cStunning grounds - Shame about the staff!\u201d","hotelReviews":16,"location":4,"Reviews":21,"service":2,"value":3,"Location":"Warwickshire","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":20,"date":"10 September 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":5}

{"User":"7Mike7","Cities":23,"text":"I stayed here and went to the Medieval Banquet , the hotel itself is a very impressive building and a great venue for a wedding. The rooms are decorated to match the hotel decor so not modern. The few criticisms of the hotel I have are with regards facilities, there is little in the way of disabled parking, only two spaces under arches near the main building, the spa/pool is not on site and is at a Virgin gym about a 10minute drive away so if you want to unpack and then relax you have to get back in the car and drive. The bar food is a bit overpriced I paid £7.50 for a basic smoked salmon sandwich with some crisps. With regards the banquet , it is in an out building a fair walk from the hotel , I wouldn't fancy doing it in winter or when raining. I have been to several including Hatfield House and a bit disappointing , there were no minstrels or dancing only word play on a stage by the performers, the music played during the intervals was modern, there was a severe lack of wine , yes you get three goblets but each held about a third of a standard glass, we asked if someone could bring some wine to the table, this wasn't possible and one of our party had to struggle back from the bar quite a distance from the hall with three bottles and five glasses. The music after the banquet was a standard disco so nothing special. As I said a great venue for a wedding or Black Tie Ball but not a weekend break , especially if you have walking difficulties, the staff are friendly and helpful.","title":"\u201cImpressive building but not for a short break\u201d","hotelReviews":26,"location":3,"Reviews":28,"service":4,"value":4,"Location":"London","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":60,"date":"8 September 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":4}
{"User":"jrandgg","Cities":9,"text":"Beautiful building and grounds. Amazingly atmospheric made more so by the low level of lighting, the antique furniture and the historical portraits. Excellent level of cleanliness and service throughout. The conservatory restaurant is very decorative and the food was very good at dinner although I am not sure how it would be on a cold winter evening with heavy rain drumming down on the glass roof. The breakfast has a good selection of everything, but the quality of the hot food lets it down badly. The scrambled eggs look insipid and taste bland, the bacon is lean but has hardly any flavour and the sausages need a coarser mix to stop them from tasting of rusk and being pulpy. Just down the drive and to the right is a Toby carvery which is very good value for lunch or dinner.The one thing it is really lacking is a lounge where you can sit and play cards, games,talk or relax, especially during the bad weather. It has so many rooms I am sure they could make one into a lounge with an open fire. There are lovely walks and cycle routes and it would be nice if they offered rental cycles or information on where to hire them. It was a beautiful, romantic stay, almost perfect. It is an excellent base for touring. Leamington spa and Stratford on Avon are a short drive away. Stratford has a hop on hop off bus which stops at all of Shakespeare's houses, which is good as Mary Arden's farm is quite a way out of town and Anne Hathaway's cottage is about a mile and a half from the town centre. A good tip is to drive straight to Anne Hathaway's cottage where you can park for £3 for the whole day and catch the bus from there. They go every 20 minutes or so. The ticket for the 5 houses lasts a whole year or you could be kind and give it away to a friend! Room Tip: Ask for one with a view and large windows as the rooms are quite dark.

{"User":"Helen D","Cities":6,"text":"I attended a Medieval Banquet on 4th August where many issues occurred from start to finish, including the admin process, rooms and breakfast. The staff at the hotel are rude and the General Manager is unhelpful and patronising when you complain about the hotel. They do not apologise for the staff\u2019s behaviour but simply make excuses and attempt to blame me for the issues, for example the breakfast problem. The administration of the event was a complete shambles. I booked this with Coombe Abbey in January 2012 for my sisters Hen Party. During this process I encountered issues at every turn: - The information on website was not clear and I was not advised of the booking process when making contact with the admin team. - I paid my deposit and received no confirmation, after chasing this up for several days; it appeared that it was sent to another email address. - When my confirmation of the event eventually arrived, it came in an email with no subject heading and no content except for a form. I had to ask questions such as check in time, the final date for payment and other general details. This apparently is acceptable to the management. - The confirmation sent was incorrect, stating the wrong amount. - I asked about another person being added to our room, and I received no reply to my email. In the end I called up and found out this information. Upon our arrival on 4th August I attempted to check in. Here the girl on reception advised me that I had three rooms booked. I said no, I have four, the confirmation says four and I have paid for four. I was not happy about this at all. I asked to speak to a member of the event admin team so I could confirm that no other details (dietary requirements) had been missed, to which a rather abrupt lady came out and confirmed the details. Her attitude was not appropriate and I was made to feel like I was being a pain. As there was an obvious admin error, my mother and I had to share a room away from the main group, which was disappointing as it would have been nice to be close to my sister on her special occasion. The banquet itself was an enjoyable event; and the staff performing did a great job. However the menu of baked potato, chicken and salad was hard to eat with no fork/spoon. I understand that the absence of fork is meant to add to the experience, but many people did not eat the whole meal as it was hard to eat a baked potato with only a knife and your hands. Also beware of sitting at the end of the benches as the plates had to be passed down and left in front of the person at the end, who almost had a lap full of leftovers on a couple of occasions. The mead was also disappointing. The general manager\u2019s response to my comments above was \u201cWe have been producing this style event for 40 years and although it is not always possible to meet everyone\u2019s expectations in general we do not receive much negative feedback\u201d. The noise overnight was also an issue as there were people shouting outside and there was noise in the corridors. I would have thought that the hotel staff would have kept this in check and controlled any unruly guests, this, however is not the case and led to an uncomfortable night. The general manager\u2019s response to this was \u201cit is not always possible to contain everyone\u2019s enthusiasm\u201d - But they do try \u2013 Apparently!? There was also letter put under my sisters door on the 4th (we did not receive one) advising them that, in order to avoid the 945am breakfast rush, it was advised that we get to breakfast early. Acting on this advice we all got down to breakfast at 845. Upon our arrival at the restaurant we were greeted by a surly and rude man, who, when we said there were 9 of rolled his eyes, huffed and puffed and seemed displeased that so many had turned up at once. I was extremely upset about this as my sister and her friends felt uncomfortable. We were then taken away from the restaurant and across the hotel to another one where the girls setting out this area said to the man (in front of us!) \u201cthey will just have to wait, this is for a private wedding breakfast\u201d. We were then taken back to the original restaurant where the surly man just left us, and a nice, polite lady from the restaurant sorted us a table out promptly. The general manager\u2019s response to this complaint was \u201cif you had requested a table for 9 at a time of your choosing we would have been delighted to accommodate you\u201d implying this was my fault as I did not book breakfast \u2013 even though I was not made aware by reception that I had to book and the note said to arrive early. I would have thought that if it was necessary to book a table for a large group, I would have been advised of this on check in. After breakfast we all gathered to check out. Upon checking out of our room, my mother was paying some cash some on her card. We handed the girl on reception the cash, which she counted and accused my mother of being £10 short - my mother was shocked and asked if she was sure, she recounted this and found that the correct amount was there in cash \u2013 no kind of apology was forthcoming. My mother proceeded to pay the other part on the card, the girl took her card and swiped it and handed it back to my mother, who then asked if she was required to enter her pin in to a machine. The girl said no, the hotel don\u2019t use this facility. We then left the hotel, but my mother is worried that, as she did not sign anything, her details are in jeopardy. I asked the hotel and the general manager to clarify this on several occasions and my query is still not answered. I am very disappointed with the treatment we have received with the admin issues with the booking process, the issue with the rooms and the attitude of staff in general, especially the breakfast incident as we all felt as though we were being a nuisance. This was a one off event that was important to us and I am not impressed at all with the service received. I was especially upset by the General Mangers patronising replies to my complaint, where she did not apologise to me for the above issues once but simply made excuses and attempted to blame me. The offer of a half price murder mystery event was of no compensation for the way we were treated, plus it would have only been a disappointment and waste of time and money again. Don\u2019t bother if you want to happily celebrate a special occasion.","title":"\u201cDon't Bother!!!\u201d","hotelReviews":4,"location":3,"Reviews":8,"service":1,"value":1,"Location":"Birmingham, United Kingdom","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":7,"date":"6 September 2012","sleepQ":1,"rooms":3}

{"User":"Elaine M","Cities":2,"text":"My partner and I stayed at Coombe Abbey on the 29th August 2012. Entering the hotel it was very atmospheric. We were, however, disappointed that our room was not ready for us having to wait nearly an hour after we had arrived to gain access to our room. They did, however, look after us with drinks while we waited in the main foyer. The room was fantastic. A large room with a 4 poster bed, hidden bathroom, with a deep large bath which I thought was brilliant! The room was very clean and overlooked the driveway and moat. The hotel is very gothic in style with low lighting which gave it bit of a spooky feel especially with the full moon out! I am glad my partner was with me! The breakfast was of a high standard with a great choice. I also very much enjoyed the hot chocolate and I just wish I had asked for more! Overall, I would recommend Coombe Abbey and hope to return one day. Room Tip: We had room 140. A large room with a 4 poster bed, hidden bathroom and a deep large bath.

We have never stayed over night but our guests have done and reported that it was excellent. There are also beautiful gardens and a picturesque lake. Coombe country park is next door.

My wife and I decided to make a night of it and paid a very special rate of only £85 for B&B for 2 people and were offered a 3 course dinner from a set course menu for £17 each and accepted. A charming, historic, luxury country hotel near Coventry and close to the M6. A new feature is the excellent conservatory restaurant and bar. There were 2 weddings taking place and reception kindly agreed to move us and in fact upgrade us to a room in a quiet area away from the noise of the disco via one of the weddings. No fuss at all and a very nice, larger room with a four poster bed too. Afternoon tea was very good and was very popular too. After moving rooms on the same corridor, we went for a quiet drink in the bar next to the conservatory restaurant. We began to talk to the Restaurant Manager who was from Turkey and he was very pleasant and helpful answering questions about the food + wine menus. He then offered us one of the two gazeebo locations to eat, which with the soft lighting at night was fabulous. The 3 course set menu for £17 was excellent value and good taste too. The wine list was comprehensive and offered a wide range of choice and prices. Very impressed and quiet too, despite 2 weddings going on in SEPERATE part of the hotel. Breakfast was a buffet style. The hot English style breakfast was fresh and a waitress kept a close eye on how this was being consumed by guests. Nothing was any trouble whether asking for more tea or toast etc. The staff were a mix of experience, maturity and youth. A good blend! Everything was really laid back and our fears about the two weddings impacting our one night stay did not materialise. Coombe Abbey arrange many \"Special Events\" and I encourage you to visit their web site and see what suits you. Look our for \"off peak\" special rates like £85 B&B for 2 people (e.g. on a Sunday night etc). I should say that our \"original room\" had 2 single beds and was not as good as the room we were upgraded too, but you would expect that as you would normally pay a 'premium' for such an upgrade of course. The evening meal set menu is very good value at £17 each. I would recommend the Afternoon Tea also if you preferred not to stay overnight. You are not far from Warwick, Stratford, Leamington and Kenilworth, so there is a lot to do in the area IF you choose. I WOULD CERTAINLY VISIT AGAIN FOR SURE.

It fills very quickly. The grounds are beautiful- and a walk round the country park was just perfect. I do have a couple of negative points to note- but they didn't in any way ruin the stay for me. Check in can be quite time consuming as only 1 small desk with 2 receptionists- and quite a few guests checking in for 2 weddings- but we weren't in a hurry so it wasn't a problem. It is quite dark in reception and in the room we were in- but that is part of the atmosphere for me- but will remember to take a light up mirror for doing my makeup next time!! There wasn't an easily accessible plug socket near a mirror for hairdrying/straightening.

We parked in the car park and went in to check that it was ok to leave the car despite us not being able to check-in until later, however, Garry (who throughout our stay was exceptionally helpful and informative) was on the reception desk said that there were rooms available if we wanted to have a look at them and decide which one we would prefer. We were blown away by all 4 rooms - 2 were in the Abbey itself and 2 were in the newly built Priory at the back of the Abbey. We chose room 231 in the Abbey itself in the end (it was a really difficult decision as all 4 were amazing in their own right - all with very different features). Our room had a Queen Anne bed and a roll top bath in the room itself, which was set in the corner on a raised platform (photo's attached). Everything tiny detail in the room was fascinating and too numerous to mention, it was very clean, comfortable and accommodating in every way with the lovely fluffy thick towels, bed linen, bath robes, toiletries, tea/coffee making facilites and much more!! After unpacking we went around the grounds which are really beautiful and ideal for couples as well as families, we had lunch in the cafe at the Visitors Centre which was very nice and reasonably priced too. There are many different walks that you can do and as the sun shone, we did all of them and managed an ice-cream too!! On the evening we had booked into the restaurant for a meal. There is a notice advising people of the dress code, which is smart or smart/casual as many people are celebrating special occasions. This was helpful and very much suited the whole ambiance of the Abbey. We had taken clothes which were suitable to 'dress for dinner' as there are not many venues now that mean you can 'dress up', it added greatly to making the evening a wonderful, special experience. The food is of a very high standard, it is fine dining at its best, which we thorougly enjoyed. The following morning we went for breakfast, which was once again quality in the choices of food, which from the selection available, there was something for everyone. (Jodie was particularly hard working and helpful). There are lots of superb features within the Abbey to take in, its atmosphere, architecture, history are superb and it's lovely to stay somewhere that retains those aspects as well as provides a warm, welcoming, comfortable stay. We can't praise the staff enough, right through from the moment we entered the Abbey to when we sadly had to leave. Thank you to everyone, you are a credit to the Abbey.

We stayed overnight in the Abbey in a feature room, which was absolutely gorgeously decorated and had a beautiful four poster bed which was really comfortable. We were able to look around the hotel and found it fascinating with it's small library in the reception area and the telephone box disguised as a confessional box.

We had a 'feature room' (overlooking the lovely courtyard) with a super four poster bed. The restaurant was an elegant conservatory - and the food was superb. I have dietary requirements, but the chef was very accommodating. All staff were also very helpful and friendly although not all au fait with surrounding area. Surrounding Coombe Abbey were the beautiful grounds of Coombe Country Park (owned by the Council) which adds to the charm. There is a 'new build' in the grounds of this hotel and before we left, a member of staff was kind enough to show us some of the top category rooms ... which were absolutely fantastic with decor in keeping with the main building. Probably the most impressive rooms we've seen. However, it was suggested to us that if you had never been to the hotel before, on a first visit you might like to stay in the main part of the hotel for full ambience and so forth. Plenty of things to do in the surrounding area (e.g. Witley Court and Gardens) - although beware - many National Trust and English Heritage properties are closed on Mondays (as we found out to our dismay!). If we were nit-picking, the only thing (small) we would say is that our bathroom did not contain enough shelving space - one morning our towels were left on the floor because there was nowhere to put them!

{"User":"windiescricketfans","Cities":3,"text":"We booked two rooms for myself and my husband and my son. The hotel entrance and public rooms are very plush/atmospeheric and in keeping with the age/ambience of the building. However we had 2 issues: The carpet in my son\u2019s room (Crown bedchamber) was wet just ahead of the door entrance (resulting in wet socks) after he had kicked off his shoes after a long day. I attributed this to the air con unit above but rang reception to report. Although the duty manager was despatched fairly quickly, he said yes it was wet but didn't make any offer to dry, relocate or compensate. Secondly my husband is currently unable to eat beef but really fancied the mixed grill from the a la carte menu. When we asked both the waiter and the restaurant manager if the steak within the mixed grill could be substituted for something else (we were open to any offers), we were told that the mixed grill portions were pre-cut and therefore they were unable to do this. There was no way to add another lamb cutlet or piece of gammon instead as this would have to be taken from another mixed grill portion which would render that portion useless! For a restaurant with rosettes and a hotel with stars, to not be able to cook individually or meet a guest's requirements with something already on the menu seems very restrictive and narrowminded. (They wouldn't even cook a sausage as the substitute, which must have been within the larder as sausages were on the breakfast menu!) Was expecting the lap of luxury for the price but felt like we were being labelled a nuisance for the hotel's failings.","title":"\u201cCustomer service needs improvement\u201d","hotelReviews":3,"location":4,"Reviews":4,"service":3,"value":3,"Location":"macclesfield","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":0,"date":"15 August 2012","sleepQ":3,"rooms":4}

On arrival we received a warm welcome and were shown to our room, a suite in a newer building. The room was nice and the bathroom even nicer, but it was lacking a few essentials (I expect a mini bar at this price). We wanted to order a few drinks but the room service menu was also missing, we had to try ringing reception three times before someboday answered and brought us a menu. We went to the bar instead but this is very small and was already packed with conference delegates, which made it very noisy. We managed to find somewhere to sit and patiently waited until the dining room opened (they don't serve dinner until 7pm) as we had booked for the start and had been told to be prompt as they were busy. 7pm came and went and still the dining room wasn't ready for guests, my husband asked if we could be seated but was told they were still setting up and so we would have to wait. At 7.20pm they finally opened and we were shown to our table which was nice and the service from then on was very attentive. However, given that we had been told they were busy, imagine our surprise when during the entire meal we were one of only 4 tables in the entire restuarant - why were the staff so keen to lay the whole restuarant up for dinner at 7pm when so few people were there?? We both had lovely meals, though, and the food was delicious and very well put together. Breakfast the following morning was also very good, although again they were quiet but had still managed to let the buffet get quite low. All in all we had a nice night but the service wasn't quite up to scratch and at this price it should be.

We first went over to Coombe back in April 2011 and we were met by wedding coordinater Joanne, who made us feel warm and welcome when we arrived. As it was our first venue we looked at i didnt think that by the end of the appointment with Jo that we would be booking our big day, but how wrong was I. My first impressions when i walked in were WOW and as we were guided around it just got better and better and there was no way i was leaving that place till we set our date, which we did. We chose the Abbey gate to get married in, the West Terrace for after the cermony and The Cloisters for the wedding breakfast and Party!! We Arrived on the Friday and was greeted by very helpFul porters and Joanne. Again they were all so welcoming, took all of our wedding gear off of us, as you dont travel light to these things and showed us to our rooms, which were absolutely stunning. NO COMPLAINTS WHATS SO EVER!!! The morning of the wedding it was raining but by 9am we were blessed by the sun for the rest of the day and evening showing off the stunning beauty of Coombe Abbeys grounds, they are spectacular!! I was greeted by James who was our MC who looked after us throughout the day and made sure things ran smoothly and i have to say he never let us down, he was exceptional. The Abbeygate was more then i expected and took my breath away, as did my husband to be!! . As for the cloister, well again another gold star for Coombe looked fantastic.The Food and service for the wedding breakfast was 5 star and in the morning due to high quantity of guests staying they re opened the cloisters and put on a breakfast buffet for everyone, was lovely!! Also 5 stars goes to the bar staff at the evening doo, they were very cheerful and couldnt do enough to make sure everyone was happy!! I seriously have no complaints about our day and neither did our guests. We werent only looked after on the day but from the day we met Joanne she never failed to help with queries or it was never a problem to sort something out for us, She is an exceptional lady and with her help made our day everything we wanted and more!!

The reception staff were very friendly and welcoming and even obliged my request for one of the rooms to be upgraded to a feature room as it was a special occasion. The other 2 rooms booked were crown bedchambers, which although perfectly fine, did feel a little cramped for space. If I were to visit again I would definately try and afford the grand feature rooms as they do look far more spacious. The hotel was very atmospheric and although very dimly light, this added to the charm. Overall the staff were very friendly and accomodating, particularly front of house and in the restaurant. My only criticism would be of the barman, who seemed unable to smile or even acknowledge my existence. We were later told by another bar person that he was in a mood and didn't want to be there that evening. This is unacceptable behaviour for a hotel of this quality and this barman really needs to take a course in customer care... and soon. Apart from this one individual all the other staff were fine and very courteous. The other criticism I have is that tables around the bar and in the ante rooms were left cluttered with glasses for long periods even once the customers had left. This along with the sticky bar surface did tend to show a lack of tidiness and care taken by the bar team. The restaurant on the other hand seemed to be handled with professionalism and was a delight to have our evening meal in. Breakfast was very good with a large choice. All in all I would definately recommend Coombe Abbey even though a few areas could be improved upon, these are minor issues which hardly impact on your stay at this atmospheric hotel.","title":"\u201cAtmospheric hotel\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":2,"service":4,"value":5,"Location":"Northampton","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":0,"date":"18 July 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":4}

Booking directly, I secured a superior double room and dinner deal complete with an \"arrival pack\" of flowers, champagne and chocolates for just under £290. I considered this resonable for a top quality hotel. However, on arrival I admit being dissappointed with the room. It was relatively small, and although interestingly themed and quirky, had some broken fittings and things like a dripping shower. Not brilliant. The Champagne, flowers and chocolates were in the room as expected when we arrived at 7:30pm, but they had been there a while so had warmed the ice bucket to a water bucket. I immediately rang room service to request a new bucket which they said was no problem. Unfortunately at 8:30pm we were still waiting for this to arrive. Not impressive. I reported the issue to receoption on the way to dinner and the duty staff apologised and promised to \"attend to it now\" (which they did). Dinner was excellent. No quibles: good food, attentive staff, great surroundings (we ate in the conservatory). Excellent value and reasonably priced: beautifully presented. My second issue with the hotel began the following morning Thursday 11th July at about 6am. The banging/bashing/slamming began. The rooms (at least ours) are not well noise insulated... Every movement on our floor seemed to wake us and several times I felt Caroline start as a particularly loud bang shook the room. Also, and I respect chambermaids and the job they do, but two had THE LOUDEST conversation you can imagaine around 8am.

{"User":"Draycott18","Cities":25,"text":"We opted to stay at Coombe Abbey for an anniversary, after staying at their sister hotel (Lumley Castle) several years ago. We opted for 2 night B&B rate in a Feature Room. We arrived on the Sunday to find the hotel very busy with the Olympic Torch team based at the hotel for a couple of days. This didn't cause us any problems, as the hotel is plenty big enough to cater for corporate events and not have a major impact on other guests. The room itself was a good size, with canopy bed, 2 x large backed padded chairs, large TFT TV screen, large bathroom with shower over bath, and an excellent view of the moat and front of the hotel. The room was in one of the front turrets. The gardens were beautiful, as the hotel is adjacent to the large park, and the gardens of the hotel are well kept. We ate at the hotel on the second evening, and found the food and service to be good in the restaurant, although the choice was a little bit limited. As others have already stated, we were not aware of the bar menu, and only found out when leaving the restaurant on the second evening. On the first night we were looking for as slightly less formal meal and ended up going outside, but may well have eaten in the bar had we known. Now onto the slight problems we encountered. Nothing major, but worth pointing out. As seen above, there was a lack of information both in the room as well as in the hotel. We didn't know about the bar menu and also any other facilities available. We hear that there are afternoon cream teas available, but only found out afterwards. Also, the hotel offers free wifi throughout the hotel. We were able to connect to several access points throughout the hotel, but although we had a good signal, on both devices we tried, it said no internet access available. We asked at reception twice if there were problems only to be told that their PC could attach OK, and it must be our devices. We also heard other people, including the Samsung people (with the torch relay) saying that the internet wasn't working. Overall, this is a very nice hotel for special occasions, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others, but, given the price and marketing for this hotel, it could be that bit better.","title":"\u201cWonderful place, but only if.......\u201d","hotelReviews":14,"location":5,"Reviews":41,"service":3,"value":3,"Location":"nottingham","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":34,"date":"10 July 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":4}

{"User":"MummyChubby","Cities":10,"text":"We booked the weekend direct with the hotel on the Wednesday, we were offered b&b rate or B&DB rate we opted for the B&B as we didn't know what time we would be arriving. We arrived on the Friday late afternoon and checked into our room, the receptionist was very polite and told us which way our room was, I then asked about booking dinner in the restaurant for the Saturday evening, she gave me the telephone extention number to make a booking. As soon as we got to our lovely four poster feature room I rang the number to be greeted by a very helpful man who told me that the restaurant was full both evenings but that I could go on a waiting list to eat at 9-9.30 but he could not guarantee that we got a table as it depended on the guests leaving. I was a little upset as we had looked forward to dining in the beautiful garden room. We have stayed at this hotel before and really enjoyed the atmosphere and food. We got ready to go for drinks in the bar that evening, The bar is fairly well stocked but they do not do cocktails (many lady guests asked for them) we sat and listened to a number of people moaning that they could not get in the restaurant, the staff were very apologetic but could do nothing except put their names on a waiting list. This is a very large hotel with a few function rooms, the restaurant area is not big enough for the size of the hotel, if people are booking on DBB rate they know how many people are in the hotel in advance, non residence can eat here aswell. At no point did any member of staff inform people that they could have a bar meal if they could not eat in the restaurant, one lady asked if they could recommend anywhere close by to eat and the waiter informed her, he could have told her the bar menu was good and they could eat anytime up until 10.30 (I think). My husband and I decided to have a bar meal that evening, we both had steak, which was superb and served very quickly. A few glasses of lovely champagne later and it was off to bed. We stayed in room 005 which had a very large four poster bed, the room was very dark which added to the character, but it was difficult to see. Mirrors everywhere but not one with enough light to do makeup easily. The bed was very comfortable but only had a sheet, one blanket, and a throw over with no extra bedding in the room if it got cold. I found the pillows uncomfortable, but thats just my preferance. You could not see the tv from the far side of the bed as the curtain was in the way so you had to lift it over the bed, this was not a problem. tea and coffee making facilities are ok, but no water is provided, the hairdryer had seen better days and no iron or ironing board was available in the room. Breakfast the next morning was fab, with buffett service tea, coffee and toast was brought to the table, lovely selection of fruit, cereal, juice and breads, the cooked breakfast at the buffett was scrambled eggs, fried bread, baked beans, sausage, bacon and mushrooms, if you wanted your eggs done any other way you had to order them with the waitress, I ordered tomatoes as I like them with my breakfast and they were brought out within minutes, nothing was too much trouble. We had a lovely stay and we will go back again without a doubt but we will make sure we book our table for dinner well in advance although I would be very happy to eat of the bar menu. This is a character hotel full of charm and quirkyness.","title":"\u201cAnother special weekend away\u201d","hotelReviews":9,"location":5,"Reviews":10,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Norfolk, England","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":9,"date":"9 July 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":4}
{"User":"KateEngland","Cities":4,"text":"I love this place, I have been to 4 medieval banquets here and my husband and I have visited for a few special occasions and we have always had a wonderful time. The food and the atmosphere of the medieval banquets are certainly worth experiencing and they are very good value for money. If you have any dietary requirements do mention them and you will be catered for. There is a cloakroom at the Abbeygate so you can leave bags, coats etc. As you enter the abbey it's just like stepping back a few hundred years, yes, it is very low lighting but it wouldn't work with bright lighting, it's to give the effect of candlelight, which is the whole point. The whole place is amazing, it never fails to enchant me. I've only eaten in the abbey's restuarant once but it was a very good meal and the service was excellent. The breakfast is very good, with lots of choice. The bedrooms are beautiful, a comfy 4 poster bed (I've only ever stayed in a feature room), there are all the things you would expect, a tv, kettle etc but these are hidden in old wooden cabinets etc so you still get the authentic feel of the room. The adjoining bathroom is also in-keeping with the original style, I love the bath a really deep, roll top style. The bathrobes are gorgeous too, really thick and comfy.

The park surrounding the Hotel were gorgeous and lovely walks. This hotel has one of the best variety of food for breakfast out of all the hotels we have stayed at. Very gothic throughout but but bedroom was a bit warm and would not wish to stay there if the weather was hot. Quite low lights in reception and corridors which take a bit of getting used to when you come in from outside. The staff were very polite and nice. Had a lovely meal in the restaurant and they could not have been nice enough and handled my food allergies with extra care. Only let down if I had to pick something was the service in the bar area which, handled properly, would be a great earner for the hotel but whilst we were sitting there we noticed people coming in, ringing the bell for service and finally leaving when nobody bothered to answer.

The grounds were outstanding , and the food was good and the reason for the 3 rating. If I were rating the room only or the entrance area, it would have been a two. The owners have a property so full of potential. I would recommend that they close down for a month and redeploy their staff to steam off the old wall papers, rip up carpets, and paint the interior a pleasant shade of off white. It would turn the whole place around. Gothic is not the appropriate word for the ambience in this property.

{"User":"perfick","Cities":22,"text":"I attended a medieval feast event in June and it started well when we were shown into the historic building for a drink and a wait for the begining. The monk music being played added to the atmosphere. As we were taken in to the hall it started to go down hill. We were taken to a long table with wooden benches. There was a problem as there was little room and another couple complained but we were all bunched together. In front of us was a steak knife. We were entertained by some actors who were playing the part of the court. This amounted to singing some bawdy type songs an introducing the feast. The food was a total disapointment and in no way could it be defined as a feast. The first course was a soup in a small bowl. It was not overly good. The second course was a spare rib on a plate. The main course was a chicken leg and a jacket potato with a small bowl of salad beween 7 people. The final course was a bowl of crumble. This stodgy dish defeated many on our table as little of it was eaten. The food was not of good quality and the wine was generaly agreed by my fellow dinners as very rough and not pleasant. Apart from a vegitarian option there was no choice of food. Throughout the dinner the actors contiued to entertain with saucy type songs. This event was supposed to be a feast but in truth it was far from that and the main point of the evening was the acting. The evening finished with a disco. I would say that this was a sing song evening with a bit of food and not a fantastic evening of feasting. At £39 a person I would expected far better quality food.","title":"\u201cwhen is a feast not a feast\u201d","hotelReviews":19,"location":4,"Reviews":28,"service":3,"value":1,"Location":"essex","cleanliness":0,"Helpful":29,"date":"28 June 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}

If you\u2019re looking for something luxuriously romantic and quirky that will take your partner\u2019s breath away, I\u2019d highly recommend Coombe Abbey.

The hotel itself is lavishly decorated and makes home to plenty of intricate detail. Our bedroom was clean, plush and both bedroom and bathroom were extremely comfortable. The staff at Coombe Abbey were pleasant and the chef whipped up a delightful self-service breakfast. Usually, the use of crumby self-service heated trolleys infuriates me as the beans are congealed, bacon is like eating shoe leather etc but this was NOT the case at Coombe Abbey \u2013 they got it spot on.

We had a spring bloomer package for the Saturday might which was £95 for B & B. I felt this was about right. I think we may have been lucky to get this deal as when I called to book I was firstly told that the offer had ended (in fact it did not end until 10th June) then was told it did not apply on Saturdays. Again which was not true I had to speak to a manager to get our deal. We really enjoyed our stay but I do feel there is room for improvement. It just so happened I forgot my hairbrush - the staff did not have any left and no-one offered to get one for me so I had to spend the 2 nights without brushing my hair! For a hotel of this standard this was poor. However, the food and wine were excellent. You have to find your way in the garden room - you cannot just sit in there and have a drink which is a shame as it is a beautiful room. The day we arrived we went for a glass of wine about 5.00 pm and we told rather rudely by a female member of the bar staff that we could not sit in the garden room despite there being empty tables. We were told the seats were all fully booked for afternoon tea but this was patently not true as no-one ended up sitting at those tables anyway! That said most of th eother staff went out of thier way to be helpful. Finally, I did not find the bed confortable - the mattress was old and springy and the pillows were flat and shapeless.

{"User":"chrisborne","Cities":9,"text":"stayed here on business (and have done so in the past at their sister hotel in the North East) they do create a medieval atmosphere and the feeling of a bygone age, its just a pity that the staff mostly dont seem aware of this, and behave, in my opinion, dis-interested and completely bored with their jobs....... Im not sure whether its because the hotel is large or whether the management transmit an arrogance, but staying in this style of hotel should be an experience not just an overnight B&B......... I ate both evenings in the restaurant and it was almost like I had shocked the staff who seemed totally surprised to see a person turn up to eat (as if it was the first night of opening)! The food was quite good, very expensive and the main courses the size of a starter but otherwise fine. However it did seem a little odd to be charged more for the soup from the table d`ote than from the a la carte, I asked why but no answer was forthcoming from the waitress and no-one follwed it up either by telephoning my room or at check-out.......... Breakfast was good but again no real welcome, just someone standing around waiting to be approached by guests rather than the other way around. I am dis-abled and the hotel only has one parking space which is very narrow and i could not park my car and get out of the vehicle because of the stone pillars on either side, there was a great space just to the right of this but was told it was reserved for the owners Mercedes........ I rest my case, and had to duly park some distance away in the car park field, I wasn`t even asked if i wanted to leave my bags before re-parking, quite amazing.......The girl on reception however was very efficient and asked if she could reserve a table in the restaurant and continued to explain everything required at check in. The room was fine a little dark but great comfortable bed and good TV.The only further point I would like to mention that upon returning after work on day 2 I called at reception to ask for my ker and to ask if they would again reserve a table for me for dinner, only to be told by a more mature lady who should infact know better that the restaurant was over to the right and they would deal with me............... quite apalling, especially since there was absolutely no one around in the resaturant . I know this is a small detail but one which determines whether along with the other points previously mentionedwhether I stay again or indeed recommend to friends.","title":"\u201cnon plus dazed staff\u201d","hotelReviews":10,"location":4,"Reviews":13,"service":2,"value":3,"Location":"Doncaster, United Kingdom","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":9,"date":"4 June 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":3}

We could just have done with a few more seats in Cloisters Bar for those who wanted sit and talk. The Lindley Suite was perfect for entertaining on the night before, however wardrobe space was limited, and the furnishings though, were just extraordinary for those pre-wedding photographs.

The afternoon tea was very pleasant, staff were friendly and helpful with regular top ups of tea and coffee as required. It was very busy but this gave the atmosphere a nice buzz and didn't seem to affect the level of service. The hotel inself looks beautiful from the outside and is set in lovely grounds with a lake and formal gardens as well as country park and this was a real bonus. We enjoyed strolling around the grounds in both the evening and the following morning. Inside, the hotel is decorated to look gothic, although a member of staff revealed that the main building was only constructed in 1991! They've done a very good job of making it look authentic. The hotel does tend to keep it's lighting levels very low; it adds to the sense of being gothic but sometimes the lighting is rather dim. The new bedroom wing of the hotel (built in 2005) is a modern red brick building from the outside but inside is decorated in a very similar manner to the main hotel. If you can stretch to it go for a grand feature room, really very, very nice! Breakfast was the usual buffet style affair and had a good range of everything you could want. A very enjoyable stay. All the staff were very friendly and helpful with the exception of the bar staff who for some reason were the opposite. One word of warning, we stayed on a Saturday night and they had three weddings and a medieval banquet going on at the same time. The noise levels in the hotel were quite noisy until the early hours of the morning - if a quiet stay is very important you may want to check what they have going on or ask where the quietest rooms are likely to be.","title":"\u201cGreat weekend away with friends\u201d","hotelReviews":4,"location":4,"Reviews":12,"service":4,"value":4,"Location":"Brackley, United Kingdom","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":3,"date":"31 May 2012","sleepQ":3,"rooms":4}

I booked the romance special which included a 3 course meal and flowers, champagne, chocolates on arrival. As soon as you drive up the long drive the hotel looks very grand, an impression which only increases as you walk accross the moat to reception. The room was a good size with a very grand 4 poster bed, the bathroom was a good size with a nice shower (no issues with water pressure or temperature). The champagne was very nice, the flowers were beautiful and still look stunning sat on our dining table, the choclates were very nice but alas there were only four in the box :+( We went for a walk around the grounds which were stunning and then had a Pimms and Lemonade on the patio (long walk from the bar to the patio). Relaxed in the room for a bit and then got ready for dinner. Dinner was amazing, the food was fantastic and very well presented. The service was superb and i would recommend that everyone eats here whether a guest or just if you're passing by. Breakfast was also very good, a nice cooked breakfast with the normal choice of pastries, cereal, fruit or whatever else you may fancy. Then our only complaint, the bed, it was awful, it sloped to the middle and at one stage during the night i was actually assaulted by my partner after rolling on to her. I managed a few hours sleep alas she didn't get any. I would give Coombe Abbey another try as the hotel and food were top drawer.

I had originally booked a crown bedchamber but was able to upgrade to a feature room upon arrival. I was shown two rooms - one in the new Park Priory (newest part of the hotel) and one in the main abbey itself - both rooms beautiful but the abbey won me over and we had a gorgeous room over looking the moat at the front of the hotel, We had all the usual items you would expect to see plus fluffy bathrobes, trouser press, tea/coffee making facilities etc. Reception/Porter staff were very helpful and attentive and our luggage was brought up to our rooms. Could not fault the room but would say the rooms in the main house are now looking a little tired and need some TLC - don't let this put you off....its the pure ambience of staying in the abbey itself that has a special feel and charm. Our bed was up on a two step plinth (room 3) and its makes me smile when I read other reviews of people saying the rooms are dark - yes, they are meant to be....which is why this hotel is labelled \"No ordinary hotel\" its all supposed to add to that ambient feel and as it would have been all those years ago. That is what makes this hotel special. Breakfast was plentiful and although buffet style was hot and lots of choice. We had afternoon tea on our second day there and this was lovely (£27 for two). They were fully booked but as we were residents the staff made sure we had a table. The grounds around the abbey are simply stunning and I would highly recommend a walk into the woods around the lake as you get to see alsorts of wildlife. All in all Coombe Abbey is a very beautiful hotel, its certainly far from ordinary and I hope they manage to keep that ambient feel. I will certainly return to stay here....may even upgrade again to a Grand Feature room next time. It's worth it. Room Tip: If you can afford to upgrade then do so....the extra's are worth it.

Quite a spectacular room, with an equally stunning bathroom. The room is huge with a very high ceiling, the four-poster bed very grand with a huge silk canopy over the bed on a platform with steps up either side of the bed with fancy balustrading all around it. The room was comfortably furnished with antique furniture, various china, flowers etc. The natural light was very good as was the lighting there, to the extent in day light the carpet in the room and the bathroom was very faded in places and badly stained and somewhat damp smelling in the bathroom, new carpets are necessary now, especially as it is used as a 'bridal suite'. I did mention this to reception. Overall though this didn't spoil our stay, the views of the knot garden and lake beyond was beautiful as was the room, especially the fantastic coving. We had a small decanter of sherry, fresh fruit and sweets provided in our room at a table by one of the windows, a nice touch. Sadly one of the glasses had a nasty crack in the glass and both had lipstick marks on (ugh!), this was put right though via the young man who cleaned the room next morning. Our dinners on both evenings were very, very good though a little pricey. We ate from the set menu and the a la carte, both equally excellent and similarly priced. Breakfast was very good too. Our complimentary cream tea was very nice, though service on that particular afternoon slow. The staff we met were all very nice, they made us feel special in the restaurant, which we appreciated, and reception staff and the porter like-wise were very nice and friendly. We enjoyed our stay overall and would recommend Coombe Abbey Hotel. There was much talk of 'ghosts' and 'celeb' visits alike from the staff, however, we saw neither during our stay. The hotel reception is very 'gothic' and deliberately kept darker for atmosphere, I rather liked the feel and 'drama' of it all. It's worth a visit to have a look round, especially if you like historical buildings and antiques as we do. The hotel is more geared up towards functions and conferences (Land Rover were there whilst we were), but quite honestly we hardly saw or heard anything. Same for the weddings, we saw beautiful grand rooms after the receptions were over but never heard or saw large groups.

{"User":"mangua83","Cities":5,"text":"This is a beautiful hotel that provided the back drop for my new fiance to pop the question during our stay there. Without a doubt one of the happiest and most wonderful evenings for me regardless. However I know my partner was disappointed with what he thought his money had paid for. It did not occur to him when booking this wonderul surprise that we would end up staying in the \"new\" build at the back of the hotel (which he didnt even know existed) He chose a feature room on the basis of many of the rooms having features such as a roll top bath, bathrooms hidden behind bookcases, four poster bed etc. Whilst the room we had in the Priory was by all means a lovely room (spacious, clean and a lovely big comfortable bed) the reason he picked this hotel was to stay in a room full of history and character. So, in some ways felt a little \"short changed\" by booking a feature room. None the less we had a lovely stay as this was a very special occassion for us, despite me feeling like there was a lack of warmth or hospitality from staff in general. We didnt even get a simple \"how was your stay\" when we checked out and very little eye contact. We had dinner in the conservatory in the evening and again, even though the staff seemed quite disinterested and not the greatest service, the food was without a doubt delicious. The main part of the hotel is beautiful and full of so much detail, ambience and history. On this alone I would rate Coombe Abbey as \"excellent\" but I did feel that the overall level of 'customer service' was a bit of a let down considering we have stayed in places before that have cost a lot less money but the service was above and beyond. Perhaps on our one year wedding anniversary we shall return to celebrate and have our fingers crossed we do actually get a room in the main part of the hotel.

{"User":"DucksCrossing","Cities":2,"text":"We only live 45 minutes away and had never considered Coombe Abbey until my wife had an email offer from Secret Escapes. Whilst the reception area seemed a little dark at first, it added to the ambience. The wood panelling and stonework were exactly as expected. The staff were very helpful, particularly where my wife was in a wheel chair following a high heels incident. Our room was in the Priory wing, and was wonderful. A massive double bed and period decorations. The menu was a little limited but the quality was first class. The only niggle was that the associated spa use was agreed through a Virgin sports centre which you need to drive to, and is not the easiest to find if you don't know the area. If you don't want to swim or exercise, then Coombe Abbey is. Great place for a quiet break. If you need a bit of fun, try the Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham about 30 minutes away.","title":"\u201cA great relaxing bank holiday break through Secret Escapes website.\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":2,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Northampton","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":2,"date":"23 April 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}

Room was lovely, so clean and not a speck of dust anywhere, we even got our bed turned down and a little note from Kath wishing us a good night's sleep. Hope she was real and not one of the reputed ghosts, which we hunted for, but sadly did not see. ( Although for some reason, I did wake up at ten past three which was not due to the bed, as this was extremely comfortable). The food: well, we dined in the restaurant which was busy with both what appeared to be local people and guests. The food was wonderful, especially the lamb and the creme brulee. The cheese board was full of local produce and was AMAZING! We sat in one of the tent/gazebos in the dining room and this was a nice novelty. There was a wedding on and we chatted to a couple of guests who informed us that they were having a great time. This did not seem to impact on our stay or any of the service. Breakfast was also very nice indeed. It was our 20th wedding anniversary and we certainly felt that the hotel lived up to our expectations. (We used the Friday night getaway package, so the meal, room and breakfast were included). Do have a walk around the grounds which are very grand and also through the woodland. Also do explore the hotel, lots of interesting things to see and places to sit and nurse a glass of wine or two!

We did tell them it was our anniversary, so felt we were given a special table in the corner. Again, breakfast was super, plenty on the buffet table and a good cooked breakfast as to expected with good choice. Our feature room, in the main part of the Abbey, wonderful - dark but atmospheric.

{"User":"MichaelWinnerRIP","Cities":25,"text":"Coombe Abbey was a Cistercian monastery in the 12th century. In the intervening period it has seen many changes. The oldest surviving part is the Cloisters, dating from 1500, prior to the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII. For some 300 years thereafter it was the home of the Earls of Craven. A moat was added and there's even a portcullis - probably more for aesthetic reasons. Today it is a first class hotel, steeped in history and beautifully maintained. Our rooms was on the first floor and very comfortable. Styled individually, all rooms are full of character. We dined in the main restaurant and found the food very good - I had venison saddle which was very tasty. Our choice of wine was St Emilion - again very good. The cheeseboard offered excellent English cheeses. We slept well and enjoyed an excellent English breakfast. Overall, I strongly recommend Coombe Abbey, perhaps not for children, but a great stay for adults who appreciate history, culture and good food.","title":"\u201cUnique and comfortable\u201d","hotelReviews":7,"location":3,"Reviews":45,"service":4,"value":4,"Location":"York","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":42,"date":"17 April 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":4}

{"User":"Bobgrey","Cities":9,"text":"We attended a wedding on April 14, and booked in for two nights. Reception staff were polite and helpful, but we were surprised to find we were staying in an annexe outwith the main building. The decor was fine for a period style building, but the lighting is very dim given the rooms are painted dark pruple with heavy drapes. The bathroom door wouldn't close on the catch, and therefore couldn't be locked, and looked as if it had never been able to close from the day the door was hung. When I pointed this out to reception, were were immediately offered another room, which at that stage we declined as it was not a great problem, just a niggle you did not expect to encounter in an hotel of this level. Dinner was slow, almost two hours for a three course meal, but the food could not be faulted, and the restaurant staff were polite. The main bar really is not condusive for an evening drink as it is small, and a through way for everyone going to and from the restaurant. The only problem we had was on returning to the annexe room. A fan was running non-stop in the cavity between the room and the bathroom, and afer switching off the heating and removing the key card from the slot, it just would not stop. I thought a seven hour drive followed by a late meal and few whiskies would send me to sleep quickly, but the din from the fan woke me time and again all through the night. After complaining in reception at 7am, we were immediatel asked to to move to another room, on the top floor of the main building overlooking the moat with a wonderful view up the main drive. The difference was like moving from a Butlins holiday camp chalet to a VIP suite in Claridges. The wedding went without a hitch, the staff were attentive and professional, the meal was very good, and the party had the use of two rooms, one for a disco and the other for a quieter drink and time to relax. Breakfast on both mornings was adequate, but I would have hated to be a late arrival as the bain-maries barely kept the food at eating temprature. The choice was standard, sausage, bacon, egg (only scrambled!), fried bread, mushrooms and beans, with tea and toast at the table, plus the usual cereals and fresh fruit. All in all, it was an enjoyable weekend, in delightful surrounding, but if we were to consider staying again as individual travellers, we would ask for a specified room within the old building. Coombe Abbey Hotel appear to very good at their speciality, wedding parties, coping with up to three at a time over a weekend. Not the easiest of tasks given the numbers involved. However, their attention to the bigger picture appears to have diverted their attention from the minor details, such as ill-fitting doors and non-stop fan motors. It is a beautiful venue in stupendous grounds, the food was good, the staff were polite and attentive, and overall, it was an enjoyable stay. Room Tip: Insist on a room within the main building.

{"User":"ESSLichfield","Cities":0,"text":"I attended an evening wedding reception at this beautiful hotel a few days ago. I have visited the hotel before and it was very memorable and fantastic. Alas this visit paled into comparison. The evening was fantastic, the venue was wonderful, the food was brilliant, everyone was having a brilliant time, it all came to a very abrupt end, when the police surrounded the marquee in a very aggressive fashion, as apparently they had been called to a riot that had been reported, with their dog's, their vans and their taser's, & their backup, why the police helicopter overhead could not report back that, things appeared to be very calm I am at a loss to understand as it had been a huge mistake. The hotel management were nowhere to be seen or the hotel security, sorry the security were hiding outside behind the police. It was a total shambles and the wedding quests had to try to piece together what the police were doing there, it was just unbelievable confusion, We half expected some fugitive on the run to be hiding in the shadows, and the police had tracking him to the marquee, arrest him and take him away and we get back to enjoying ourselves. children were frightened and crying, myself and a number of other guests had to go to the reception in the main part of the hotel, to find a senior member of staff to find out exactly what on earth was going on. I was very unimpressed with the half hearted interest & attempt to try to take control of this situation. upon returning to the the marquee with the Duty Manager, things had taken a turn for the worst, my 70 year old uncle was pushed to the floor by the police and nearly trampled, and the groom had been arrested, which was the whole intention when the police arrived. A very sad end to what had been a fantastic day, The Bride and Groom had spent a fortune on their fabulous day which was totally ruined by total incompetency, lack of communication between Management & Hotel Staff & Security and Police, unprofessional-ism, in dealing with a confrontational and highly emotional situation, which could have been resolved and the evening could have continued. It is total, total, shame. Once the groom was taken off to the cells, we were told to leave the marquee and return to our rooms, the hotel bar was off limits to our wedding party. It is also a shame that when attempting to get some breakfast at 9am the next morning, there was insufficient staff, the tables were insufficiently prepared for guests, there were no bowls or cups for cereal or coffee, we were the forgotten ones, I do think waiting for 20 minutes for some toast after asking 3 members of staff is a bit much. would advise. I would think long and hard about booking a large reception at this luxury hotel, with a fabulous reputation, with wonderful staff that will make it such a memorable day, they did make it a very memorable day!!!!!

However, what transpired later in the evening was completely unexpected and unaceptable. The hotel security and management completely misread the situation and wrongly informed the police that 200 guests were rioting in the Marquee. In actual fact the atmosphere in the marquee was happy and was one of the most enjoyable celebrations we have attended. There was no drunken behaviour or anything that could be read as threatening. In fact there were many children and an variety of ages attending this occasion. What followed was like a scene from a local derby football match, excessive police presence, a police helicopter and dogs (I trust the hotel will be paying for this and not the tax payer). The groom was understandly upset and we feel that this could have been sorted out quietly and successfully with a quite word, and if felt necessary by the hotel, two police personnel at the most. The evening was brought to an abrupt end which left everyone upset and with a feeling of complete disbelief. We do not blame the police for turning up in such numbers, they were just acting on the information given to them by the hotel. At breakfast it felt like the wedding party had been ushered into a room that had hastily been prepared for breakfast. There were no cereal bowls, cups on tables and basically we were left to help ourselves without instruction from staff, althouth we must say we feel the two young people left to attend to guests were rather dropped in at the deep end to get on with it. What a poor display from a hotel that sets itself up as one of the most exclusive venuses in the Midlands.

{"User":"leeallsopp","Cities":0,"text":"I stayed here for 2 nights with my girlfriend and 2 children, aged 9 & 2. On approaching the Abbey, we thought how beautiful it looked. Our room was booked over twelve months ago as we were part of a wedding party. We were really looking forward to staying in the old Abbey as my girlfriend has a love of old buildings and this was a real treat. We paid quite a lot for the room as it had an interconnecting door through to a second smaller room for the children. We went to Reception to book in and were given directions to our room. I have to say we were very disappointed as the room we were given was actually outside at the back of the Abbey in a 'New Build' . We knew friends staying too so we know we hadn't paid less than those staying in the Abbey itself. At the end of the day we paid to stay in Coome Abbey not a new block of flats in the grounds. At no point were we informed that we would be staying in a new build, in fact we didn't even know the new build existed until we arrived. If we had known before, we probably would have requested to change the room, but unfortunately it was too late on the day of arrival as all the rooms were now fully occupied. At dinner the service was terribly slow. We waited an hour for each course, which is not very good when you have a very hungry 2 year old. Our daughter ended up filling up on bread rolls as her main course took so long to arrive, and we had to ask them for that too. Eventually a huge bowl of pasta arrived, (ridiculous for a small child to try and eat) so we then had to ask for a smaller bowl and smaller cutlery, by now she was too tired and had filled herself up on bread, so her meal was totally wasted. We also had problems with the swipe cards used to enter the rooms. We had to enter through an outside door and then an inner door to the room. We started off with four cards, 2 for each of the rooms, by the end of the weekend none worked! We constantly found ourselves locked out, having to call Reception and then wait for a Porter to finally arrive to let us in. Eventually we were told not to keep the swipe card near a mobile phone as it can erase the information, we had to make several trips to Reception to get the card reloaded, sounds simple stuff, but when you have a very sleepy child and bags to carry, just popping back to the room ends up being a nightmare, my girlfriend actually missed the weddng photos as she had called back with our 2 year old to collect confetti. Then to top if off our friends who were married in Coombe Abbey had many mishaps throughout the day, including not having the correct music played in the Abbey, and their 80's disco ended up being a compliation from 5 decades. The wedding was scheduled to finish at 1am, but was shut down at 11.30 when Police Officers turned up in force to shut the wedding down. The DJ and Bar Staff abandoned the Marquee', no-one was told what was going on. We later found out that the groom had rightfully asked the DJ to play 80's music as requested and because the DJ was not happy about this, he had informed the Abbey and the Police were called. The Groom was rightfully very angry, they had paid thousands of pounds for their very special day. We think this was totally blown out of proportion, the staff could have sorted this out in a much more professional manner. If they had asked the DJ to play what had been ordered then none of this would have happened. The whole situation was blown out of proportion and my children were frightened by seeing so many Police Officers! The Bar in the main Abbey was still open, but apprently was closed to any members of the wedding party. A total farse I have to say. We will be writing to the Abbey to complain about our experience. Its a shame such a beautiful place is let down by bad management and service. Room Tip: Ask where your room is situated when booking to make sure it is in the old Abbey itself and dont exp...

Unfortunately this was going to be the only part of the day that would be amazing! Upon arrival we were greeted by a very big, obnoxious man who looked down his nose at us and didn't even have the courtesy to be polite, the words please and thank you were not in his vocabulary! After pre-wedding drinks we were ordered to go into the ceremony room where the wedding took place and everyone enjoyed celebrating the union of the bride and groom! After drinks and canapés we then moved to the room for the wedding breakfast where we had a lovely meal and was served by a lovely young lady who couldn't do enough for you! Although the constant loud interruptions by the same obnoxious man at the start of the day did start to get annoying!! After a short break we then moved to the marquee area for the reception beautiful room with a lovely warm buffet and treats and entertainment laid on by the new Mr & Mrs!! Lots of dancing to the tribute band and artist commenced and everyone was having a wonderful time until all of a sudden the bar staff shut the bar and the dj starting to pack up without any explanation or reason! To make matters worse we were informed that a large number of police had arrived and that apparently we were all causing trouble???? You can imagine how upset the bride and groom were as what they had dreamed would be a perfect day had slowly turned into a nightmare!! To add insult to injury the groom was escorted off the premises and arrested for no reason ther than requesting the dj to play the music he had specifically informed the venue he wanted playing! I believe that this so called wedding co-ordinator ( the large obnoxious man) was rude, snobby and totally over the top in his treatment of the guests throughout the day and in the way he treated the bride and groom at the end of the night! Who would have thought that wanting 80's music played at your wedding reception (as previously agreed) would result in you being banned from the premises and not spending the rest of your night with your new bride and family and friends? I would never recommend this venue to anyone and certainly not for them to hold their wedding or reception there!!","title":"\u201cBad Manners &amp; Snotty Attitude, Disappointing for the Bride &amp; Groom\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":3,"Reviews":2,"service":1,"value":1,"Location":"Cannock, United Kingdom","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":4,"date":"11 April 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":3}

We answered not and was asked to turn around and park in the furthest car park away. We entered the huge and must say beautiful, grande marquee. The bar was in the middle of the marquee with only 3 bar staff serving(i thought it was going to be a long night). The bar staff did their job and served the customers, that was about it - no smiles or banter or pretty much anything really. We had been at the wedding reception 3 hours when i saw the bouncers clearing all the beers and spirits out of the bar. A few minutes later i went to get a drink and there were no bar staff in sight, all the tills had been emptied and there was no alcohol to be seen. 5 minutes later there were 12 police officers standing all in a row in the marquee. no one had a clue what was going on. The groom got very upset and wanted to know what was going on and why all the police? Everyone in the marquee just sat in amazement wondering why all the police were there. In my mind whatever had gone off certainly didn't justify having 12 police officers in the area. It was ridiculous! nobody apart from the groom (rightly so) was causing any bother. Maybe if the groom hadn't paid ALL the thousands of pounds up front then they would have thought twice about sending for the police. The argument could have been resolved quite easily but Coombe Abbey had their money and closed the bar,disco and evening down. Shame on you Coombe Abbey! May i advise anyone going to Combe Abbey to pay a small diposit until after their event - because when they have ALL your money in their grasp you will be treated poorly.","title":"\u201cBad Attitudes!

The reception staff were friendly and welcoming and we were directed to our room. it is certainly stunning and full of character very dark and sultry lit! We had the luxury of the 4 poster bed en suite room which was lovely and they had put both our rooms together 238,240 ( I think!) The were lavishly decorated and Overlooked the forecourt . It had a lovely coffee tray , fresh flowers in the room would have been a nice touch considering the expense but I suppose then people would complain about hay fever LOL !! The en suite was behind the bookcase which was a fun twist :) the sink had a huge crack in it which I was petrified might break and we would be blamed ! So had a lovely bath which was fab and great toweling robes provided :) people have also ruined the stools to sit on by putting straighteners and marking the furniture :( Bed had sheets and blankets quite soft and comfortable . I noticed the windows could have done with a good dusting down and carpets are threadbare in places so if you want new don't come as I suppose this is in keeping with the place. Stencils in ladies toilets very very dodgy which lowers the standard of decor :( looks a bit like a bad \"real rooms makeover !!! \" great place to explore though. Drinks came to a reasonable price £15 for 2 martini and lemonades and 2 lagers . Cream tea looked lovely. Conservatory area nice and airy to drink in . Evening meal nice and you can use the cost of the set menu towards other items chosen off a la carte if you wish . Service quick and friendly.menu lovely and can't fault the food however on asking for 1 extrabowl of chips they produced a cheap bowl of French fries at quite an expensive price !! Notgood :( Breakfast also lovely however had to wait ages for fresh croissants which nearly all disappeared after being bought through but luckily friends got in there quickly :) Think a one night stay is adequate but banquets look fun and shall probably return! Priced quite expensively for the room we had considering no spa or pool or any activities to do but for a 40th surprise it was lovely...... No extras chucked in by the hotel to surprise me though !

There were a couple of weddings going on which is fine but every outside area where we could take a drink we were told this was for the wedding party only. The staff seemed to be quite rude about this too and there was nowhere for \"non wedding\" guests to sit and we were treated like second class citizens.

The rooms and bathrooms were very clean, the only problem for us all was that the fan in both the bathrooms were on the whole time as was the green light that should come on in an emergency. We had afternoon tea one afternoon and ate in the restaurant two evenings and I must say that whilst the food is very good the service was very poor. We had to wait 30 minutes before anybody took our order for afternoon tea even though there were very few people in, and a further 15 minutes for the scones to arrive. The evening service was also quite poor for a restaurant of such quality, we had to ask for serrated knives for the mixed grill, we had to ask for soup spoons for the soup and on the first evening no napkin was supplied with the wine in the ice bucket. The staff lacked professionalism. The second evening was rather better, we were served by a young man from Greece and a Dutch lady who seemed much more professional. We found the breakfast very good, but why no rolls when you are serving cheeses & cold meats?

It had a dark blue/maroonish theme - heavy drapes, and bed cover, with a large bath/shower in one corner (that was curtained off). The toilet was on the small side but perfectly ok. Hanging space was limited to a curtained off corner of the room. The bed was very comfortable, but a queen and smaller than we usually sleep in. Overall I liked it.

The rooms are all individually decorated, even the rooms in the new block separate to the hotel. The furniture, bedding, and decorations of the rooms are all antique in style, so don't expect gleaming modern furniture, the four poster bed we had was dressed with sheets and a blanket. At first we were concerned as used to 21st century duvets, however I can honestly say it was one of the most comfortable nights sleep I've had. The rest of the furnishings from armchairs to TV cabinet and writing desk were all old and very authentic (not often you can find a genuine Elizabethan TV cabinet). The room was also very quiet. Even though there were three weddings going on, and our room was situated just above reception, the corridors and room itself felt very quiet and isolated. The only noise came from some unthoughtful guests outside leaving the hotel after a wedding bash. What made the stay special was the attention of the staff. They were always very helpful and pleasant. One occasion stands out: On the second day of our stay we decided that we wanted to try the mediaeval banquet event, however it was sold out. A member of staff heard us try to book at reception and told us that he would try and sort it out for us. That evening we were told that we had been booked on to the event. Apparently after he had gone home he had phoned back to check for any cancellations, then asked for us to be booked on the spare places. Breakfast was of good quality, and in a lovely conservatory setting. On the first morning, there was an unexpected rush, and some waiting time for dishes to be replenished on the buffet, however something was done about this to make sure that the next morning, the same mistake was not made. We booked onto both the Murder Mystery night and the Mediaeval Banquet. They were very entertaining, the actors really seemed to enjoy themselves, which made far an excellent atmosphere where the whole audience really felt involved. There was no choice in the food, but this was secondary to the highlight of the event. The courses were of decent portion size, but nothing to write home about. Although the menu for the medieval did have the novelty of only having one knife each as cutlery, quite a challenge if the firs course is a bowl of soup. The hotel has no leisure or spa facilities, however they do have an arrangement with a gym that's about 10 mins drive away. Room Tip: 140 has a bathroom hidden behind a bookcase door.

Seven years ago we stayed in the main part of the hotel and enjoyed almost all of it. This time we were located in 'The Priory' which is a modern block built behind the main hotel. The hotel has 'attempted' to recreate the feeling of the main building in a modern setting and I think they have failed. The room was large and atmospheric which means dark! We were on the ground floor overlooking a garden which was being used by hotel wedding guests for smoking. We were booked in for a meal in the Conservatory at 8pm but were held in the bar for 35 minutes and despite the fact we had ordered in the bar our starter took another 20 minutes to arrive. The starter was good and the dessert was fab but the main course of pork belly was dry and chewy. Neither of us slept very well as despite us having set the aircon to 'off' it was still going all night which meant the air was just two dry. The remote contraol didn't work on the TV and the wrong newspaper was delivered in the morning. All minor points but they all add up to an impression regarding lack of detail. Breakfast was good with a selection of hot or cold options. However, rather than the romantic weekend we had hoped for we checked out as early as possible as the room was just too dark and dreary.

{"User":"M_and_B_Belfast","Cities":10,"text":"We were invited to attend a wedding here. As we approached the building we could see that this was going to be a wonderful venue. However, nothing prepared us for the setting that awaited us. Refurbishment works, fit out, decor and furnishings have all been carried out contemporaneous with the original abbey building. This in conjunction with the beautiful grounds and spectacular lake provided an amazing setting for a romantic wedding ceremony and reception. The ceremony was performed on a dais in a prepared hall in what appeared to be an old stable block called the Abbeygate. The design of the hall allowed the celebrant and bridal party to be easily viewed by all the guests seated in the hall. The master of ceremonies provided by Coombe Abbey was flamboyantly attired in keeping with the setting and was constantly with the guests and bridal party throughout the day, effortlessly shepherding everyone to where they needed to be in this large and complex building. After the ceremony the guests were accommodated on the West Terrace over looking the lake and formal gardens while the Bridal party were having photos taken. This had to be the best venue for a drinks reception that i have ever experienced aided by the warmest, sunniest day in March for many years.Wonderful. After a blissful couple of hours our master of ceremonies led us to a beautiful dining room with an ornate plastered ceiling for a sumptuous meal, no rubber chicken and tasteless mash here. After the speeches the Master of ceremonies concluded events with a poetic and touching blessing to the newlyweds. Perfect. The guests retired to the private bar adjacent to the room while it was prepared for dancing , later in the evening a buffet was provided for the revelers who continued to the small hours. Every member of the plentiful staff played their professional, polite, friendly part in the package provided by Coombe Abbey. All in all a superb service which i was told was only marginally more expensive than a package provided by standard hotels which do not have the exceptional advantages and quality of Coombe Abbey. Just one note of caution, on a wet dark day in December the halls and bars might need extra lighting though i would not be surprised if the management have anticipated this.","title":"\u201cWedding Bliss\u201d","hotelReviews":6,"location":0,"Reviews":17,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Belfast","cleanliness":0,"Helpful":7,"date":"27 March 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}

Some succeed in meeting your expectations and occasionally some exceed your expectations. Sadly in this case our expectations were not met. The building and setting certainly had the WOW factor and met our expectations but after that it was down hill. Inside the hotel was very very dark as were the bedrooms. The bedroom we had was well equipped no problem there but loud slamming of doors up until about 1 am ruined our night\u2019s sleep. Dinner service in the restaurant was a let down, the a la carte Menu was significantly different to one on the web site, nearly 2 hours to serve 2 courses in a Michelin star restaurant may be acceptable but this is defiantly not approaching that level of cuisine.

I have to say the food was of an excellent standard from the cream tea to breakfast and dinner. We kept bumping into Tony the duty manager who was very polite and informative, he was very keen to tell you about the history of the place and could not do enough for you.

It was our first time at the hotel and we agreed that it was actually better than we'd expected. Set in beautiful grounds with a moat and the dark lighting inside made it feel more atmospheric. In places it felt as if we were on a film set. Our afternoon tea was served in the garden restaurant which was very light and spacious. The food served was very fresh and delicious with generous fillings in the finger sandwiches. The scones were very light and melted in the mouth. At £13.50 for a full afternoon tea we thought it was very good value and would like to return again to sample more of this amazing hotel.

{"User":"leiceterboy","Cities":34,"text":"The first point i'd like to make is that the hotel is very expensive for what is on offer. The website and marketing material gives the impression that this is an elegant hotel set in extensive manicured grounds. It is true to say that the building is very pretty and the grounds close to the hotel are nice but beyond that it feels like a municipal park. Much of the grounds are open to the public with extensive car parking all over the place. The car park for the hotel is a long walk from the hotel itself and the warning signs all over the place 'not to leave valuables in the car' don't fill you with much confidence. On the inside the hotel is very dark and dingy and the rooms very tired. They will always try to fob you off with the worst room they have got so be prepared to ask to move rooms. The food is ok but the prices are very high, as this is a themed hotel there are always a lot of different events going on in the hotel at the same time so it gets very busy. Check your bill carefully before you leave as we found a very expensive drinks bill had been added to our bill and when i asked for a signed receipt they acknowledged they did not have one....

There were some staff members who were very helpful, however we received blank stares when asking for any sort of assistance (i.e. we asked for directions to a local restaurant, as well as help setting up couples massages since the hotel does not have a spa).

We had heard about the lack of cutlery and weren't sure how it would affect things but, I think it enhanced the overall night by using your fingers. Food quality and quantity was quite good. Not large gourmet portions, but you don't want to be stuffed full while still trying to enjoy the entertainment. We had a group of young girls celebrating a birthday near us which drowned out some of the stageshow but they quietened down later when the play/story got going into the songs and audience participation.

{"User":"Catious","Cities":8,"text":"Having previously experienced Coombe Abbey's catering for Christmas, we were to a degree prepared for the experience. We can not claim to have been disappointed, having arrived with quite low expectations. If we had been arriving with no prior experience and not having read other reviews here, of having believed the hype of Coombe's own site I'm sure we would have been furious. This simply is in no way at all deserving of 5 stars I think 3 would be fair. Yes Coombe was a spectacular period property, which has now been extensively remodelled to suite the hotel trade. Any original features have now been totally overwhelmed by a cheap and often broken or faulty, stage set mock medieval meets Victorian pastiche. Some may like this, I don't, so I will say no more on this. However if you are claiming to be a \"good\" hotel, some things should be of a faultless standard. You do not expect threadbare carpets, broken furniture in rooms poor service and truely diabolical catering. Not all the staff were surly jobsworths, although the bar staff were, the waiting staff were the only ones we would like to single out for any praise. In our experience the reception staff were not as bad as portrayed in other reviews, but the breakfast was so much WORSE! I really did not believe that the breakfast could be as poor as others have described, but it was indescribably badly cooked, presented, and clearly used the cheapest of cheap ingredients, how hard can it be to employ someone to cook breakfast to order? It's not exactly requiring a Chef after all! Congealed reconstituted powdered egg scrambled, tinned mushrooms swimming in brine and oil, bacon stewing in a similar mix, sausages of indeterminate provenance, light orange Lidel value range baked beans and deep fried sliced value bread, all left to stew slowly over a Bain Marie. I can't comment on the quality of the fruit cheese, cereal or pastries as I wasn't brave enough to try them, but the toast arrives cold and not toasted, there was no butter on the table the tea was tepid. You would ge a better breakfast at Corley services just up the M6. To sum up, you can excuse the shabby furnishings by saying they add to the experience, but you can not excuse the poor service, ABYSMAL food and the fact that the management are clearly aware of these issues but do nothing, not even bothering to respond to reiews here.","title":"\u201cSuch a shame\u201d","hotelReviews":6,"location":2,"Reviews":8,"service":1,"value":1,"Location":"Highland Sassenach","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":6,"date":"4 March 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":3}

We had invited 50 customers along for a product launch and the idea was to provide a special and memorable location, rather than having the meeting in a bland indistinguishable corporate business hotel. This place did the trick. If you compare it to a modern hotel it isn\u2019t perfect (although it is nice enough), the magic comes from the age and ambience of the building and of course the people who look after you while you are there. The staff were very very good indeed and made a major contribution to making our stay special. As you can imagine a group of people in an activity like this can be quite demanding and critical, but nobody really had a bad thing to say about Coombe Abbey and everybody said it was a great choice of venue. There are two parts to the hotel, one old and one new, but don\u2019t worry, even if you stay in the new part it still feels like you are staying somewhere authentically historic. I had a twin room, beds were very comfortable, décor was fake old, but in keeping. There was flat screen telly with lots of channels and a really big bathroom, although it had a lowered basin so I assume it was a special room for people with mobility issues, so other rooms may not be quite as spacious. Bath was full size, nice toiletries and quilted bogroll! The only minor negative observation was that the heating system was one of those warm air blower systems and in February to keep the room warm I had to crank it up a bit and it was quite noisy. Didn\u2019t stop me sleeping but if you sleep lightly it might be worth avoiding room 160. Food in the restaurant was very good, although on the first evening I had to ask for a veggie option as the menu didn\u2019t have one, however at lunch both days there was and it was good. On the main evening we had the mediaeval banquet. It was certainly memorable, and whilst it wasn\u2019t really my cup of tea (sing along stuff and carry-on style jokes), the servers and entertainers really earned their money and put 110% into their performance, and the people who like that kind of thing in our group had a whale of a time. I didn\u2019t get to see much of the grounds but apparently they are well worth a look and must be amazing in the summer.

{"User":"iankearns","Cities":6,"text":"We had the overnight stay at Coombe Abbey Hotel booked for a few weeks but I was bit concerned by some reviews saying that they had found the hotel rooms dark and cramped as well as saying they felt neglected due to wedding events taking priority. I found all of these negative comments to be unfounded. We arrived to a warm welcome in what can only be described as truly fantastic surrounds both inside and outside. We were given our room details (in the older part of the building) and we took ourselves off to the room. We had chosen a 'Feature Room' and it was very well maintained and also well decorated in-keeping with the rest of the hotel to reflect its history. Other peoples comments about the rooms being dark are understood but considering the windows in the rooms are very small as original to the building and it was late afternoon on a cold February then this was to be expected. As soon as the super-heavy curtains we closed then the room was very warm and welcoming. The bed was very high from the ground which might cause some visitors an issue but not us. It reciprocated the comfort of the room and was very well dressed again with matching bedding to the rest of the room. As we went downstairs for our evening meal in the restaurant then we were greeted by 3 staff on the stairs whom all spoke and wished us a 'Good Evening' which was very polite and when we arrived to be seated then all the staff were very gracious. The meals from the table d'hote menu were excellent and didnt leave us feeling as though we had made any bad decisions. Two bottles of mid-priced Chianti at £28.00 per bottle were served at the correct temperature and were very quaffable! Desserts and coffees were unrushed and even when we asked if they required the table, we were encouraged to take our time and actually had the table for the entire evening (from 1930hrs until late). It was clear by other activities that there was a wedding in a neighbouring annex to the hotel as you could see guests milling around outside but never once were we left waiting or felt our table was not attended to in the proper manner. A fantastic nights sleep due to the comfort of the bed and the effects of good wine meant we woke shortly after 0900hrs and went downstairs to a buffet style-breakfast comprising of continental and also traditional foods. Scrambled egg was the only let down but I have never known a hotel be able to hold this dish without it going watery so I am not at all fussed about that. I am sure if I had asked for either a fresh egg then it would have been dealt with but there was no need. We chose to use the hotel's 'express checkout' where they supply you a copy of your bill overnight to your room and as long as you dont dispute anything then you complete and post through a letter box for them to deal with later. This was ideal as is meant the busy reception was bypassed and we could go out to enjoy a walk around the wonderful grounds. It is worth noting that the pricing of the hotel is quite high compared to other accommodation in the area but you need to consider that you are staying in a wonderful country park, in a Grade 1 listed building and experiencing something special. It is not something that I would do every week or month but for those special occasions and also for those 'one-offs' then this is a lovely treat.

{"User":"Afreeb","Cities":2,"text":"From the moment I arrived I was put on the back foot by terrible grounds lacking any signage or lighting (arrived in the evening) - when I arrived to an empty reception and had to call out for service (no notice bell etc..) I feared things weren't improving. I commented on my troubles with parking and locating reception and suggested more lighting or clearer signs to which I recieved every guests most hated reaction.... 'the shoulder shrug of ambilvilence'. Things only went from bad to worse as I discovered that wi-fi (which was made very clear as a 'new feature' on the hotel website) was intermitent and very weak in the bedrooms and had been 'turned off' in the bar area for which I could not be given an explanation. The rooms themselves are clean and smart but are EXTREMELY heavily themed - something I shoud have perhaps paid more attenton to from the website. There were floor to ceiling ropes instead of light switches - the bath/shower is actually in the room and has no privacy to the rest of the room, the trouser press is hidden away inside a velvet panelled cupboard etc... All very good for guests taking part in the weekly medieval themed feasts im sure but actually too much for the casual or professional guest. If you are enjoying a break and think the idea of a theme hotel in very pretty grounds is your thing then this is probably the ideal place for you - but for anyone else, especially a business guest, I'd strongly advise you to think twice. **Also of note - there is virtually no mobile phone signal on Orange/T-Mobile or O2 here which is worth noting!**","title":"\u201cThemed hotel made worse by terrible service\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":3,"Reviews":2,"service":1,"value":3,"Location":"Chatham, United Kingdom","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":0,"date":"19 February 2012","sleepQ":3,"rooms":2}
{"User":"diam0nd_diva","Cities":3,"text":"This was our 3rd stay at Coombe Abbey and feel it is an excellent hotel with excellent service and very friendly staff. I agree with other reviewers in the fact that the building is very dark inside, which obviously adds to the atmosphere. We were allocated a lovely room with a view of the courtyard. The room and the bathroom were spotless, and the bed was very comfortable. We have previously stayed in 'feature' rooms which are very nice, but we stayed in a crown room on this occasion and we weren't disappointed. The meal we had was excellent and the staff attentive. Breakfast was fully waitered, and this made a pleasant change to the usual buffet normally offered. It's in a lovely location with nice walks in the park. The only negative I feel is that it would really benefit from having a spa.","title":"\u201cExcellent hotel, excellent service\u201d","hotelReviews":3,"location":5,"Reviews":4,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Nuneaton","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"15 February 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}
{"User":"2guyzvisiting","Cities":3,"text":"Stayed here whilst visiting the NEC, was looking for a country house style hotel for a treat and the rooms did not disapoint. The bedrooms we saw all appeared to be individually decorated. Only drawback was there didn't seem to be enough light, am sure it was gloomy on purpose to reflect its old history as an abbey but made it difficult to read etc. The hotel restaurant was in a conservatory with rattan style chairs/tables - felt too casual for the prices they were charging for the food. Staying midweek was very aware it is mainly a conference hotel, on the plus side got a great rate. Bit annoyed the health club wasn't attached to the building - had to drive to a local club which i didn't expect. The grounds around the abbey were great for walks. A good overall experience but wouldn't stay again.

Had a lovely private seat in an enclosed areas, service good, choice of wines v good at reasonable prices. The only down sides to Coombe abbey are that I doubt you can stay more than one night, as there is very little to do besides walking. If it had a pool or a spa, it would be perfect.

{"User":"gster200","Cities":12,"text":"I stayed here along with my partner for a wedding. We stayed two nights. Although we paid the same price as our friends, our room was a lot smaller than their's - and we were all in the old part. The room was nice, but as I said very small and incredibly dark - to the point that I had to take a hand mirror and stand by the window to dry my hair. The food was good but for the price of it you would expect good service. The staff were inattentive - wine was kept off the table but we had to ask for refills, it took 20mins to get our coffee and tea at breakfast and the staff were unhelpful and rude. The location and the grounds are fantastic but we thought it was very overpriced and that polite and experienced staff would not cost them anything.

{"User":"tigerJB","Cities":7,"text":"The Coombe Abbey hotel is a beautiful hotel situated on the outskirts of Coventry in a gently rolling rural landscape and is only 10 minutes from the M1 via the M69. The hotel is all about the experience and whether it the period architectural features of the main building or the really fun Medieval banquet there is something for everyone. The rooms are well appointed with good facilities and plenty of space to relax. I went as part of a company conference and we were all well looked after. We didnt eat in the restaurant for the evening meal as we had opted for the Medieval Banquet which was a fantastic experience, although those that do not fare well with eating food using fingers and a dagger may prefer the comfort of the restaurant. Breakfast was a buffet style, it tasted good and there was plenty of choice. The only thing the hotel does not have on site is any leisure facilities. I could have taken my partner but with no gym, spa or pool to keep her busy the day could have been quite boring. I would not hesitate in staying at the venue again we were looked after by the attentive staff throughout.","title":"\u201cAmazing hotel!\u201d","hotelReviews":7,"location":5,"Reviews":9,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Bradford, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":5,"date":"1 February 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"Chil2","Cities":4,"text":"Booked a two night stay for four of us to celebrate son's 30th birthday. We wanted something special and this hotel did not let us down. For our first night we were able to take advantage of the complimentary upgrade to \"Feature Bedchambers\" but had to \"downgrade\" to Crown rooms for the second night due to non-availability. The Feature rooms had four poster beds and included bathrobes in the bathroom but we all thought that the Crown rooms were also brilliant. All staff were polite and courteous. We ate in the Hotel's restaurant on the first evening and, whilst a little pricey, we were very impressed with it. The food was superb and the service was faultless. The whole ambience of the place needs to be experienced to be appreciated, just do it, you won't be disappointed. The only downside is the lighting, everywhere (except the restaurant) is dimly lit. The ladies found it a bit of a struggle with putting on their make-up, but hey, they looked wonderful anyway. Woulld love to go back on one of the \"Murder Mystery\" nights and probably will.

Nothing was too much trouble for Joanne, our wedding planner, and her team, they ensured everything was planned to the finest detail and ran like clockwork on the day. The Abbeygate for our ceremony was breathtaking, the surroundings are perfect and the Lady Craven is absolutely stunning . All the staff were fantastic, friendly, polite and professional and the food was superb - credit to the chef. John, our Master of Ceremonies was with us the whole day. He was fabulous, a true professional and gentleman. As we've got two children, having quite a few children attending the wedding and being so close to christmas, a visit from Father Christmas was arranged. Well, Tony Dipple - what a great Father Christmas you were! You made it so special for all the children and you really went that extra mile for us. Coombe Abbey really is a beautiful hotel.

{"User":"JohnJB","Cities":25,"text":"Stayed at Coombe Abbey for one night on a package that included dinner, breakfast and a superb suite. The hotel's main areas are outstandingly atmospheric, the building having once been a Cistercian Abbey. Thankfully the hotel management have resisted the temptation to modernise or dumb down the history of the place and the fixtures and furniture add to it's authenticity. Our room, with a 4 poster, lead light windows, panelling and creaky floorboards was stunning and had the added extra of a 'secret' bathroom hidden behind a bookcase. Also beautiful views over countryside and the hotels moat. Dinner was served in the lovely conservatory which had a very romantic and classy atmosphere. Food was excellent and service was quite exceptional - attentive, discreet and non-intrusive. Top marks all round. Just one grumble. I've become obsessive about mattresses in hotels since having the best nights sleep ever in the Radisson Edwardian Guildford. The mattress in our room at the Coombe Abbey dipped and provided no lumbar support. It was so old it must have been left there by the Cistercian monks!

{"User":"Kelly H","Cities":2,"text":"I booked for the Medieval banquet as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday, we attended on Saturday 21 January 2012. The hotel was fully booked so we couldn't stay overnight but we will go back to stay as the hotel looks amazing. The banquet was excellent, the atmosphere and setting was really special and the entertainment was brilliant with the staff being friendly and helpful. The food was very good and well cooked. We had a tasty broth and bread to start with, followed by a large spare rib in sauce. A towelling bib was provided to protect your clothes. We then had a large piece of chicken with a jacket potato. The only cutlery was a sharp knife but it was great fun to eat with our hands. Pudding was a lovely apple crumble, this was served with a spoon to eat with. Free red wine and mead was provided with the meal and I bought a bottle of the mead to take home as it was so good. The performers were excellent, even managing to deal with a very loud group on a christmas night out. The entertainment was really fun and had us laughing out loud. Not everyone went in fancy dress but I would recommend that you do as it added to our enjoyment of the evening. As we entered the banquet our photo was taken, the photographer said we could go back later and look at it on a monitor and decide if we would like to purchase it, we did as it was such a lovely photo. My boyfriend loved the evening and we spoke to quite a few people who had been before. They said that each time had been different but that they had enjoyed all of their visits. I would recommend this for couples and also for larger groups as we had a wonderful night and will definately be going back and taking friends with us next time.","title":"\u201cCoombe Abbey Medieval Banquet\u201d","hotelReviews":3,"location":5,"Reviews":4,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":5,"date":"22 January 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":0}
