{"text":"My family and I stayed at Number 16 in Ashton upon Mersey for 1 week at Christmas 2012. We had a great break, it was close to our extended family members so we didn't have to travel too far. It is a great town house for a family with young children as a range of toys, books and dvds, a stair gate, changing mat, cot, high chair and kid friendly crockery and cutlery was supplied - everything we needed but couldn't bring as we were travelling light. Amy was fantastic from the time of our initial enquiry, throughout the booking process and even emailing us afterwards to check if we had arrived in Australia (we were spending our last Christmas in the UK before moving down under). She even arranged Christmas decorations for the property and provided us with a welcome pack of essentials (tea, coffee, biscuits etc) for our arrival, it felt really homely. The only negative comments we had was that the property was cold on the ground floor in the early morning and evening - there is a lot of glass overhead and not many radiators and a draught from the front door. The throws and electric heater was welcomed but if it had been any colder that week we would have been a bit miffed! Otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to families visiting the Cheshire area.

The rooms themselves were spacious, clean and well appointed, and the hotel is quiet and relaxing. Having the facilities to cook your own meals is a Godsend while staying for a while on business, it beats relying on eating out every night! I would give the hotel 5 stars purely for the above, but the service made things even better - the proprietors went out of their way to make me feel welcome and helped in any way they could (even investigating local running routes for me when I happened to mention I fancied a run one morning).

I came for two of those weeks alone and stayed in the garden apartment. It is a studio-type fix up but has everything you need and a beautiful little garden and patio where you can sit and drink your coffee in the morning if you'd like. It was spotless and comfortable. During that time I took the tram - about a 10 minute walk away - into the city centre. For the last four weeks, my family joined me so Amy moved us over to Number 16 - a townhouse. It is BEAUTIFUL. The atrium windows over the modern kitchen make the entire space so cheerful and bright. The property is in a lovely village with a park around the corner and all amenities - restaurants and groceries - also around the corner. We enjoyed our stay so very much. Amy takes great pride in her properties and in the way she interacts with customers. She was so gracious when we had a couple of instances when someone broke a glass or plate. Number 16 is not far from a bus stop, but we had a rented car so I drove into Manchester City Centre daily. If you are from a big US city and used to traffic, the drive from Sale will seem super easy to you. It is only about 8 miles and the traffic really is not bad. Number 16 has plenty of room for a family of 5 or 6. The only head's up I would give is to remember the appliances in the UK are smaller overall. Oakfield has everything, but adjust your expectations about things like full size washers, dryers and refrigerators. Plan on doing laundry and grocery shopping more frequently. Since the village shops are open until 11pm and have everything you need, you will be in great shape. We enjoyed daily trips to the shops - it really is a nice way to live. We would definitely stay at Oakfield Court again. You will not find a better hostess, nor a friendlier village to stay in so centrally located to Manchester and the gorgeous countryside only 15 minutes away. HIGHLY recommend Amy and her properties.","title":"\u201cYou won't find a better place\u201d","location":5,"service":5,"value":5,"cleanliness":5,"date":"9 November 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}{"text":"We stayed at the Townhouse for 8 weeks, July and August, after we sold our house and before we had exchanged on our new place.

I found each apartment to be spotlessly clean, well equipped and always have a welcoming homely feel. There was a good wifi signal in the apartments, enough to hold Skype calls without too much lagging. All apartments are private and extremely quiet, I rarely heard a peep out of the other residents during my stay. Oakfield Court is located in a leafy, tranquil, residential area, good access to major routes and plenty of room for parking. The self-catering nature of these apartments provides the convenience of being able to prepare your own food, if you wish, along with the extra space that you would struggle to find while staying in a hotel environment. Personally I found staying at Oakfield took a huge strain out of working away from home for an extended period.

Frequently when I wake up in the morning at one of those chain hotels, I don't remember where I am and that is due in part to the fact they are all built to a formula and look the same, Oakfield is not like that. Oakfield has every facility that you would expect in the way of a large flat screen TV, WiFi connection, comfy double bed etc. But what they give you is more, in the way of a very clean separate kitchen where you have everything to make a meal for yourself if you desire (a nice change from eating out each time on a long stay). The separate living room has comfortable couches, a fireplace (in some rooms it was a splendid example of Victorian elegance), a desk and chair to work at and a dining table separate from the adjacent kitchen. The bathrooms are separate and clean with a bath and shower. It is unfair to describe the rooms as a hotel, they are essentially are cozy apartments, which makes them fantastic value.

Amy met me on arrival late on a Sunday evening to show me round and answer any questions. The living room was a decent size and offered a comfortable sofa, dining area and desk. The bed was comfortable and the bedroom had plenty of storage and hangers. Bathroom and kitchen were both spotlessly clean; shower over the bath but powerful and plenty of hot water. The kitchen was compact but exceptionally well equipped for one or two people and included plenty of pots and pans, properly sharp knives and unusual items like a steamer, so great for anyone who stays in an apartment because they like to cook rather than eat out. Apartments are very handily situated within easy walking distance of an M&S Food, large Sainsbury and Tesco but are in a quiet road with little noise. Plenty of on site parking too.","title":"\u201cA comfortable, spotlessly clean and thoughtfully equipped apartment.\u201d","location":4,"service":5,"value":4,"cleanliness":5,"date":"14 March 2011","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}{"text":"Stayed here for six weeks whilst working in the centre of Manchester in some of the coldest weather of the winter.
