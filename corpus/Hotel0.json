A small cosy bar with tv (sound down) and a small restaurant with good quality food, although it is a bit squashed in there I found with other guest tables. The big problem for me regarding this hotel is the parking. It's and urban location so concrete jungle, hi rise flats and other hotels which means no on site parking except the car park next door which was circa £9 for an overnight stay. The issue is that you can pay in the lobby of the hotel but it only takes coins, not even notes or cards. The car park operators insist you can pay by phone via an automated system which took me 20 mins on my mobile in the reception area setting up an account, then declaring how long I was parking for in hours when all I wanted to do was pay at the machine and get a drink!,, so if you are coming by car be prepared!

After a great stay, I thought I'd write a review and I'm not at all surprised to see this is the first choice of hotels in Coventry. The last time I was in this area, this building was an old technical college, and it's been superbly converted into a really unusual Premier Inn, retaining many of the art decco features including leaded windows and a beautiful brass railed staircase. My room was large and an interesting odd shape. Large windows looked out over the not too pretty Coventry skyline. The bathroom was spotless and what you can expect from a Premier Inn. I noticed silly things like the care that had been taken in lining up the mugs and aligning the spare pillows. Breakfast was cooked to order (I am not sure if this is usual) and the food was better than expected. The decor of the newly decorated restaurant is very nice and better than most Premier Inns in terms of style. The two members of staff that I came across - the young lady on check in and the lady managing and serving breakfast were both friendly and efficient. All in all, a really pleasant experience and frankly, you'd be daft to stay anywhere else. Parking is round the corner and paying for that is a bit of a pain, but the receptionist was helpfeul in explaining the system and getting me change.

The stress when using the official car park where you are supposed to pay before you park is bad enough, with all its rules and regulations - but beware you will certainly get a fine if you ignore the warning signs outside about the 30 minute maximum parking on the front forecourt. I ignored this on day one of check in and stayed longer maybe an hour. A month later I got a charge to my credit card of £60 as a fine for overstaying. Then because it was a rental car from Sixt the rental co hit me with another £25 \"administration charge\". So £85 in total. There is a camera covering the car park entrance. It photographs the number plates of all vehicles on the way in and on the way out then calculates the time, if you are over you will get the £60 charge. Suggest you look for street parking but it is very limited near by and you have to leave by about 10am latest as most street slots are 2 hours only from 8am.","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Location":"Sentosa Island, Singapore","Helpful":0,"date":"27 February 2013","sleepQ":4,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cCar Park Warning &pound;85 charge !\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":4,"service":5,"cleanliness":4,"rating":4,"rooms":4}

{"User":"baal","text":"Stayed here as my daughter had an interview at Coventry Uni and we found it to be one of the best Premier Inns we've stayed in.We chose to stay here as it was close to the railway station.( the city centre one would have been nearer to the Uni). The staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were large and very clean. We ate in the on site restaurant( thyme restaurant ). We payed £23 for a three course evening meal along with drink and breakfast next day. Food was typical family pub type and quite good. The breakfast next day was excellent and all foods were branded and not cheap versions. Reception staff gave us a map of coventry and highlighted our route to the Uni. They kept our case until we returned later in the day free of charge. On returning a lovely young man named James went out of his way to ask my daughter how she had done and then directed us back to the railway station. A taxi is cheap at £3:40. I would stay here again.","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"north wales","Helpful":0,"date":"3 February 2013","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cExcellent Pemier Inn\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"Balix","text":"I tend not to review Premier Inns as one is much like another but I'm making an exception for this one for a number of reasons. I'm not sure of the history but the hotel is housed within an old public building just outside the ring road and is just a short walk from the Skydome and city centre beyond. The reception staff were very friendly and only too happy to give out advice. The room was indeed like nearly all other Premier Inn rooms I've stayed in - plenty big enough, comfortable bed, and perfectly adequate. No Corby Trouser Press, mini bar, batrobes, shower caps, sewing sets etc but as I didn't need any of them they were not missed. They offer you half an hour of free wi-fi per day so even if you are staying one night you can get it twice. It is £3 per day after the free half hour. This is a better deal than many hotels though I'd still like to see all hotels offering wi-fi as a service rather than a revenue stream. Breakfast was £8-95 for the full English, not bad value at all and it is served until 10:30 which is good for those of us who don't need to be up with the lark. So far, nothing out of the ordinary for a Premier Inn. What clinches the five star rating is the fact it cost just £19 for the night. A clean and comfortable room in a near city centre location for nineteen quid? Bargain!","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Troon, UK","Helpful":0,"date":"28 January 2013","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cCoventry Bargain\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

We had to travel in terrible weather - the snow was appalling and a journey that should have taken around three and a half hours took closer to six. When we arrived we were exhausted and cold. However,the warmth of the welcome at this hotel soon cheered us up! The hotel receptionist could not have been more help and our rooms were spacious and spotless. The next morning our breakfast was beautifully prepared and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Once again, the receptionist went out of his way to help us, offering advice on how to get to the University and calming my daughter's nerves! The best part of it all was that we only paid £19 for our rooms - it was one of the best £38 we have ever spent and we wished we were staying longer.

{"User":"BigAde9","text":"We visited this hotel just before Christmas and stayed for one night. Finding the place meant navigating Coventry's scary ring road system and high-speed roundabouts, but wasn't too difficult. The hotel is the old technical college and has been open as a hotel less than a year so everything is new and clean looking. The building itself is stunning and the old entrance hall is well worth a look before you go into reception (a door immediately on the right as you go in). Very friendly receptionist and nothing was too much trouble. Unlike most receptionists I've met she seemed most genuine and didn't seem bored or wearing a fake smile. Taxis booked and change found for the parking machine with a smile. Rooms were clean and comfortable, bathroom the same. High ceilings, air-conditioning. All spotless and very nice. Breakfast had a free kids meal offer and was one of the nicest breakfasts I've ever had in a hotel. Not cheap perhaps, but very good for the quality of what you got. Parking is the only thing that isn't great, while not being terrible either. There are a handful of 30 minute parking spaces outside the front of the hotel for unloading/loading. Otherwise there is a multi-storey next door that you have to park in. At £8 for a day (payable at a machine in the hotel reception), it isn't exactly cheap and I felt a bit uncomfortable leaving the car in a multi-storey overnight. There is plenty of waste ground around the back of the building, so I don't see why this couldn't be utilised as a proper hotel car park? Only other problem was that just before checkout both our room keys (that had been working fine)stopped working... we were well before the 12pm deadline for checkout so I don't see why this happened. On balance though a very nice stay. Not quite as cheap as it first appears once £8 for parking and £8 pp for breakfast is added on, but I would argue still good value. Premier Inn have a winner on their hands in this place.","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Sussex","Helpful":0,"date":"10 January 2013","sleepQ":4,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cGreat hotel - friendly, clean and comfortable\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":4,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":4,"rooms":5}

{"User":"PKA03","text":"What a great idea to take this lovely old building and adapt part of it for the purposes of a Premier Inn. As far as the Premier Inn was concerned we were, as is usually the case, treated to a lovely stay. Friendly, helpful reception staff, excellent, efficient bar and restaurant staff, lovely room, spotlessly clean, fantastic meal in the evening and a wonderful breakfast the next morning. The whole of the Premier Inn was up to the usual high standard and our stay was wonderful. Parking was easy to access in the multi storey next door, and Coventry was within easy reach by foot. The building is fantastic and the staircase provides you with a architectural treat as all the original features are retained and the new hotel fits inside the old technical college beautifully. We were told the old theatre is to be reopened and this will make this a first class venue. The development is excellent and I would highly recommend a stay here, for the superb quality of this Premier Inn with the bonus of staying in such a beautiful building.","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Mansfield","Helpful":0,"date":"28 October 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cArchitectural Treat...\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"EssexJdV","text":"We stayed in this hotel for one night in July for my son's graduation. The hotel was newly opened and everything was fresh and new. The staff on the front desk (Kayleigh) was a bundle of fun. So helpful and friendly. The rooms were massive, clean and well appointed. The beds are really comfy. We had breakfast the next day and it was fresh and well cooked. Again the staff were brilliant. We enjoyed it so much we decided to book a return trip for a couple of days later in the year. We waited until premier Inns did a £19 promotion and booked in for 2 nights. When we turned up Kayleigh was on the desk again and immediately remembered us. The check in was simple and done by a self check in computer which produces your key cards. The staff help you with this process but it is foolproof and simple. The rooms were just as good and the breakfast if anything was better. The hotel is walking distance from the city centre and several great restaurants (Try Cosmos for a Pan Asian experience and great value) we took a trip to Stratford Upon Avon the next day as this was only 20 minutes away. The only down side with this hotel is that there is no free parking and you have to pay for the multi story next door. However there is limited on-street parking nearby as long as you park after 4pm and move by 10am as the restrictions are 2 hrs between 6pm and 8am. Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel despite the fact that it looks like council offices or a college (which it used to be)","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Essex","Helpful":0,"date":"21 October 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cBest Value around\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"Steve P","text":"I've been working in Coventry since May and have stayed at this hotel for the vast majority of this time. Having been to several nearby hotels and other Premier Inn's, I have to say that this must be the best Premier Inn in the country. The rooms are all superb, massive and with good facilities. I'd actually heard someone complain that their room was too big???? It's a very nice building as well, having been a college until being converted, so much nicer than staying in some purpose built hotel which lacks any character. (Theres always the Ramada opposite for that) It's also in quite a good location, being only about 5 minutes walk from the Skydome and city centre. I've even brought my family down to stay midweek on a couple of occasions during the school holidays, and nothing was a problem for the hotel. The restaurant and bar are excellent, very reasonably priced and I've always had great meals. Breakfast is also superb with a massive amount of choice. Overall though, the reason I've chosen this hotel as my base during the week is all down to the staff. From the reception staff, to the bar/restaurant and kitchen staff, to the hotels management, they've made me feel unbelievably welcome. I'd like to name some of them to see they get recognised, but as every single one of them is great I fear I'd miss someone out! I've witnessed just how helpful they are time and time again, and this is the reason that they get so much repeat business. Well done to everyone at the hotel, you're a credit to Premier Inn's!","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Sunderland, United Kingdom","Helpful":0,"date":"6 October 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cAbsolutely superb!\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"Kopite52","text":"This was a much anticipated stay for me as I spent 4 years in Coventry Technical College in the 1970's as an engineering apprentice and I was keen to see inside the building again 40 years later. Premier Inn have done a great job in the conversion of their half of this lovely iconic building. [There aren't many lovely period buildings like this in Coventry so I was happy to see how well it has been used]. Check in was quick and easy with help from the friendly front desk staff to use the auto check in counter. I loved the old staircase in the building it's hardly changed from how it looked 40 years ago after a sympathetic renovation - lovely. The staff is this hotel are great - they are well trained, personable and a real asset to PI. I especially want to commend 'Norma' a waitress in the breakfast room and Kyleigh (?) on reception very very helpful ladies. Also James the bar manager was great and Paul on breakfast service. The rooms are standard PI if a bit larger than normal - very comfortable bed and pillows. Being a new PI (only 9 months old) the bathroom is very new and everything works really well, with a great shower. Rooms are cleaned very well each day. The breakfast is great all you could want and is well cooked and delicious. The bar/restaurant has been decorated quite stylishly and is a \"stand out\" in Coventry which is not blessed by much style anywhere and this is better than its normally dismal pubs and restaurants. I've already mentioned Norma in the bfst room who has great customer service attitude - couldn't be more helpful (employee of the month ?) Now the 2 negatives. 1. Parking - I didn't even attempt to go in the hotel car park - so many awful things have been written about it - I didn't want the stress nor the cost. Side street parking is quite difficult - I was there 5 nights and always got a spot (just) either in Albany Road (limited to maybe 20 cars or less) or in Butts/Queens Rd outside all the local restaurants. Parking here is restricted in the day till 6pm to 2 hours. Very difficult if you can't get in these 2 roads - the Rugby Club next door looks 'safe' but they have clamping threats posted all over the fence. Better not risk that. Across in Windsor St is possible but hard to get a spot and it isn't great walking back from there in the evening. All the side roads off Albany Rd are 'residents parking' only. So parking IS a big problem - you may be lucky but it's 50-50 most nights if you'll get a spot 2. Smoking - any kerb appeal the old college has is ruined by literally hundreds of cigarette butts discarded on/in/around the main entrance - not a very nice welcome. Nobody ever seems to clean or sweep these up - why isn't someone in management looking at this and ensuring it's done, this is a terrible first impression. Looks like the back door exit of a nightclub on Sunday morning - there seems no pride in anyone wanting to clean it up. Why would you want this to be the 'Welcome' mat for your customers? Shame on you. If I was the manager I'd have someone out there every 15 mins sweeping up. Would I stay again? Well it's a bargain for £29 a night if you can get one of those offers, so Yes I would stay again at that price. It's not worth the advertised door rate of £57. I would need to have the £29 a night rate but it's not worth more than that, so I'd go elsewhere if the price was higher. Breakfast was great and would make me return. Staff were all great !! Car Park issue and cigarette butts (I know it's called \"The Butts\" but that's no excuse) would mean a 'No' for me but 2 problems that a caring management can easily sort out. Over to you PI to comment please! Room Tip: Rooms facing The Butts are large and with lots of light from the big 1930's metal framed windows...

{"User":"365drills","text":"Straight to the point this venue is going to get a slap over the wrist for TWO issues. 1) Parking. Its £8+ Per night in the car park next door and this is NOT mentioned on the website (see photo uploaded) All other Premier Inns TELL you if its chargable parking. Not good! 2) Wifi IS NOT FREE as per advert out of front. Its chargable after half hour. You are allowed a taster or \"Trial\" period but its not free. So big rap over the knuckles for this. For a £58 room that adds an extra £8 for parking and £3 for wifi. When looking for a best local rate the real cost is £69 Overall no complaints about this new hotel in general. All clean and tidy. I booked this venue to be close to RICOH arena for an exhibition. But really I should have stayed out of town and near the motorways. If you want a place to crash the night there are better and cheaper without getting stuck in the Coventry ring road in rush hour. Overall I was annoyed that the \"Extras\" cost me. And when I was looking for a place to stay these things add up. Added by stealth.... ALSO one big tip. There are STREETS you can go park in if you want to avoid the £8 charge right opposite the carpark. The car park is not really \"safer\" because its open access and no barriers. My tip.

The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, especially James, Norma and Sam. They remember your name and can't do enough for you, including going out and buying my friend some tights when she laddered hers, and giving them to her on the house. The building is a lovely art deco building with a fantastic glass ceiling. I've stayed in lots of different rooms and they have all been large, with a desk and either a sofa or a comfy chair with a large, really comfortable bed. They have a choice of pillows and the cleaning standards are high. All the staff say hello and seem genuinely friendly without being sycophantic.There is a happy atmosphere and they all seem to really enjoy their work. They have handy powerpoints by the bed for your phone or your lap-top, and all the basics are there, to a very high standard. No safes in the rooms and no biscuits or bottled water, no little bottles or soaps in the bathrooms, but I never use those things anyway. They do have soap dispensers in the bathrooms and I think you can buy a toiletry pack if you've forgotten what you need. One small niggle is they say they have free internet access but it's actually only free for half an hour. After that it's £3.00 for 24 hours or £10 for a week, which is much better than many places I've stayed, although I think it should be free in all hotels nowadays.

This particular branch was located in a beautifully converted building that used to be part of a college. The staff were attentive and polite and every inch of the hotel was spick and span. The breakfast was a very reasonable £8 for an all-you-can-eat buffet (the sausages were delectable) and included everything you would expect from bacon and eggs to yoghurt and mueslei. Although my favourite part was the top of the range coffee machine. :-) The hotel is located a stones throw from the city centre but the only problem was the lack of car parking spaces. There were three disabled spaces out front but that was it. I was told that there was a Pay and Display carpark out back but luckily, we were visiting friends so we could park our car in their driveway. Having said that, we enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The bed was ridiculously comfortable and we were given two lots of pillows to choose from. Firm or soft. Also, each room is equipped with an AC unit, which was a nice touch. Premier Inn offers a money back guarantee if you have a sleepless night so you can be sure that the rooms are soundproofed well and are extremely comfortable. Even the shower was perfect as our room had a power shower in the en suite as well as complimentary body wash and soap. The only thing missing was toothpaste but my husband and I always bring our own on vacation anyway. Thank you Premier Inn.

You know what you\u2019re going to get and if you just want a good value bed for the night in a clean and comfortable room it\u2019s a no-brainer.

A tip: do NOT use the lifts as you might miss the incredible Art Deco stairways. Another surprise: the room was unusually large for this price point (a chez longue in a Premier Inn ?) - must be something to do with the really cool building again. Another piece of advice: its\u2019 9 quid to park in the attached car park overnight and the machines are cash only. The nearest cash point in the fuel station opposite charges £1.99 for withdrawals, so if you\u2019re as pedantic as we are you\u2019re walking back into Coventry to get some cash.

{"User":"stevie70","text":"We stayed here overnight and, as usual, we got a good welcome in reception. This Premier Inn has self check inn machines which seemed simple to use and the receptionist was very helpful. The room was, as you would expect, typical of a Premier Inn in furnishing, layout and cleanliness. Our room was at the front but the double glazing muffles traffic noise to a minimum and we didn't hear other guests next door or in the corridor outside. The restaurant was very good with very pleasant service and breakfast was good however the waitress was on her own to start with so could have been a bit quicker. We took the meal deal which gives 3 courses plus a drink and breakfast the next morning for £22 which gives a slight saving. Parking is in a multi storey next door for which there is a charge but you do get a discount coupon if you ask at reception. Overall, I don't think you can go wrong here. We're not overly fussy but expect good service which is what we got.","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Location":"Essex","Helpful":0,"date":"5 August 2012","sleepQ":4,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cTypical Premier Inn, can't go wrong\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"Swoshy","text":"I travel a lot on business but staying here i was having a night away with my family for the Olympic football. I was a hotel manager myself until i gave it up about 5 years ago to spend time with the family, so i find myself subconsciously judging hotels when i stay there and i really have not got a bad word to say about this hotel, which is why i am writing this review so soon(i only stayed last night!). The food, rooms and staff are amazing! The restaurant is not huge but big enough for the hotel and very modern and stylish but not over the top. The food was amazing. Fresh and tasteful. Matt(i believe?) served us food in the restaurant before we went to the game. He was friendly and helpful throughout. He seemed like such a genuinely nice guy. Also Kayliegh on check in was just the most lovely girl, we ended up standing and talking to her about 20 minutes before we went up to the room. She answered all our questions about the Olympic stadium, the hotel and the fact it used to be a college. Nothing we asked for was too much, maps, taxi quotes, timetables for trains. She also had a little joke with my daughter, who is obsessed with the TV show Friends about the characters. Cannot fault her at all. The staff when we got back to the hotel were lovely as well, although we pretty much went straight to bed, but i should point out this hotel has a 24hr bar(yes they do!). The rooms were spotlessly clean. The beds were extremely comfortable and considering we were a family of four there was still plenty of space in there. There are small flat screen TV's, with enough channels to keep the kids entertained. Bathroom was slightly small but considering there only needs to be one person in there at a time that wasn't a problem. The towels and linens were also clean, i would say brand new. soft and comfortable. The location is great as it right next to the city center but not in the middle, so without the noise. 5 minute walk or 10 minute leisurely stroll. The only gripe i would have would be the car park but remember, it IS a city center hotel and the prices are not as bad as if you stayed somewhere else, for example London! If you stay here, make sure you take a walk down the main staircase into the foyer where the college reception used to stand, definitely worth a look. It was also mentioned that the theater in the college is to be re-opening soon, something to look out for!","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Location":"Birmingham","Helpful":0,"date":"26 July 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cWhat a stay!\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":4,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"GlaseS5","text":"What a little gem. We booked this hotel with some worry, having stayed at Travelodge hotels before and tar'd them with the same brush, how wrong we were. Travelodge should take some hints from Premier Inn. First of all, the service! Upon entering the hotel I was greeted by the happiest smile from the young woman behind the desk, I would love to mention her name but she had a training badge on, the young lady was an absolute star on the evening of my stay, considering she was training you couldn't tell, printing me out a map, telling me where the best places to eat were and when we got back making sure we enjoyed it. When she said she hoped we enjoyed our stay, it seemed she genuinely meant it. The other receptionist was lovely as well, very smiley. The room was lovely, quite spacious and the beds extremely comfortable. TV, fluffy towels and good bathroom. The housekeepers obviously work hard to keep high standards. The only problem with the room was that it was slightly cold but after asking the lady on reception it was sorted within 10 minutes. I didn't park in the car park but my friend who lives in Coventry suggests the Skydome car park as an alternative. The restaurant, food and staff in there were all amazing, my friend had the steak and said it was the best they had tasted. The staff at the bar and in the restaurant couldn't do enough for you. Took their time to explain and help you. On departure i was greeted by another receptionist and another smile. Check out was simple and smooth. I can really not say enough for the staff at this hotel, they really are an assett to it and i hope the management team realises it. They really are great and as for that lovely young woman, if that was her training i look forward to seeing her next time we return, which we will most definitely be.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and did not spend every minute trying to flog things a la Rynaair. The food and drink were reasonably priced and the exit time for the room was 12.00 rather than 11.00 or even 10.00 that I have seen elsewhere.

{"User":"welshandpoi","text":"Booked a family room for a bargain price of £29. Very conveniently situated and a short drive (or walk) into town centre. Very friendly staff who seemed to really care about their guests and the quality of service. The rooms were very comfortable, clean and spacious. We intended to get up for breakfast as the restaurant looked lovely but the beds were so comfortable we overslept and missed it! Yes, you had to pay to park, but the car park was very convenient and being so close to the city centre, what else would you expect? We will definitely return and would recommend it to anyone.","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"wales","Helpful":0,"date":"14 April 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cGood value, good location.\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}
{"User":"Sharon B","text":"Brilliant Hotel, stayed two nights to visit Birmingham Gadget Show and Warwick Castle. Staff helpful and really lovely, can't fault cleanliness, breakfast, and location for us. Hotel rang us before our visit to confirm details and also mentioned parking. Parking not an issue for us as we knew we had booked a city centre hotel, only cost us £7 first night and £8 second night.

{"User":"SchoolofScience","text":"We had two rooms whilst attending the coventry beer festival. The staff on check-in were very helpful indeed, helping my dad to use the self checkin machine and the other staff in the bar were equally pleasant, very refreshing. The bar and restaurant was a lovely area and i would like to try the food next time. The building has been beautifully refurbished, with the room being spacious and very comfortable and clean. A very welcome addition to coventry's hotels.","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Coventry","Helpful":0,"date":"14 April 2012","sleepQ":0,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cBrilliant\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}
{"User":"clrchrst","text":"Stayed here for an event at the NEC, which was an easy 10 minute drive away, with two kids (11 & 14). The hotel is new so it is clean, tidy and modern. We had a really big and bright family room which had 2 single beds for the kids. This is the first time we have had this in a family room, instead of the usual fold down double sofa bed, and it was such a boon! The staff were all pleasant and friendly and very helpful. The dinner menu was reasonably priced with good offers and the food was good. The breakfast was well stocked with hot buffet and the 'kids eat free' offer was worthwhile (4 'eat all you can' breakfasts for £16). Overall we had a very comfortable and pleasant couple of days and nights and would highly recommend the hotel if you are visiting the area (Birmingham etc).","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Location":"Isle of Skye","Helpful":0,"date":"14 April 2012","sleepQ":4,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cGreat for families\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}

I stayed in this hotel for three weeks and must say I could not fault the service, food, nor staff they all were amazing.

{"User":"AndrewGransden","text":"I mistakenly booked this online instead of Coventry South Premier Inn. So take care is selecting the correct hotel. This is a newly opened PI just outside the city ring road near the city centre. It was previously the Technical College. The rooms are well fitted out and a good size but the bathrooms are minute. You can hardly squeeze in to get to the wash basin and you cannot sit comfortably on toilet. The staff are well trained being friendly and helpful. The big down side is the neighbouring multi-story car park a short distance from the hotel entrance. It costs £5 overnight but only between 1900 and 0700. Exceed this and it can set you back £9; I arrived at 1630 and left by 0800 and was stung for the full amount. It is a real ripoff and the only warning you get is a brief online warning that car parking 'may' incur a cost when you initially book. There are a limited number of dropoff parking slots immediately in front of the hotel but the access is not signposted and exiting in the morning is difficult because of the heavy traffic in the mornings. The other rip off is the sign outside that clearly states that there is Free WiFi. You only get 30 minutes free before you are invited to pay £3 per £24 hours. But it isn't 24 elapsed hours as the clock restarts at midnight. So if you want to access your emails in the morning you have to pay a further £3. In brief, don't be fooled by the cheaper prices designed to attract visitors to this new hotel. Add an additional £15 a night for essential services that should be FREE.","hotelReviews":0,"location":3,"Location":"Buckie, Scotland","Helpful":0,"date":"10 March 2012","sleepQ":4,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cNew Hotel but watch the expensive parking\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":4,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":4,"rooms":3}
{"User":"Mrandyd","text":"You know what you get with the Premier Inn brand - Clean functional hotels, and this was no different. Set in a magnificent building which my kids likened to a museum, especially with the collonades flanking the entrance. Good location 10 mins walk from the city centre. You need to cross the ring road to get to Coventry, either under a series of underpasses, or via a pedestrian crossing. We stayed in a family room with a double and two fold out kids beds - The room was big enough to accomodate our needs. TV has Freeview channels. There are tea / coffee facilites. There are functional places to hang clothes, and drawers to store smaller items. Soap / shower gel was dispensed through dispensers. Our room faced inwards to a courtyard. The bottom half of the window was frosted so we had little to view, however there was ample light into the room, especially as the windows were double height. We ate in the restaurant twice, and had breakfasts every day. The lunch / dinner menus were simple an good value. I am under no illusions that the majority of the food was prepared offsite, therefore foodies may baulk at the idea at eating at the restaurant, but my palate is not so sophisticated to deny me from enjoying the food. The restaurant / bar staff were excellent and made us all feel special. They are all a credit to Premier Inn. As the person below states - The hotel has no car park, or for that matter gym or pool, but then I knew that before booking, therefore it would be wrong to criticise the hotel for not providing that service. With Premier Inn the price you pay is variable. I paid £19 a night for the room and an extra £8 for breakfast for the kids and I. I think I got a bargain, and would pay more. However once you start paying £70+ for a room you would start questioning whether there are products out there with parking and pools which would be better value. However if the price is right this is a great hotel to enjoy and will stay again.","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Hinckley","Helpful":0,"date":"10 March 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cCheap and cheerful\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}
{"User":"MrsF82008","text":"This was our first stay at a Premier Inn as we normally use Travelodge. Fortunately, this happened to be the closest \"Budget\" hotel to where we were visiting and we could not have been happier with our stay. The hotel has only recently opened so everything still looks fantastic. The staff were fantastic, really helpful and friendly. We would not normally eat dinner at a hotel like this but decided to give it a go as we had arrived quite late and we were not disappointed - it was great - all freshly prepared and very tasty and well worth the money. Ditto the breakfast which was cooked to order. The whole experience on our opinion would have been cheap at twice the price and we have now decided that we will always use Premier Inn in future. We also got a great nights sleep as per their guarantee!","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Plymouth, United Kingdom","Helpful":0,"date":"5 March 2012","sleepQ":5,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cExcellent service and lovely quiet room...\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}
{"User":"Rasher26","text":"This was my first ever stay over in Coventry, and this hotel was chosen only due to its proximity to work. It is, however, one which I will be using each time I now need to visit the same office. The room I had was spotless and roomy with a very large double bed, adequate wardrobe space for luggage & clothing and lovely bathroon with bath & shower. The staff at reception & in the dining room were very welcoming, pleasant & courteous and the breakfast was excellent - buffet style for coffees, teas, fruit juices, cereals, toast etc. and/or order as much cooked breakfast as you want. My only complaint would be that there was not enough coffee, milk and sugar in the room but I'll let them off on that one :-)","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Runcorn, Cheshire","Helpful":0,"date":"20 February 2012","sleepQ":4,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cExcellent for overnight stay\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}
{"User":"oceanomad","text":"I stayed in this Premier inn a few nights ago and must say that it was excellent. Of course it is very much like every other premier inn and comes with no frills, however it was fantastically clean and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Built in the old college i believe, the rooms are spacious. Too tired to venture out to eat at night we decided to eat in the restaurant. The food was good, and service just fine. Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Coventry or visiting nearby Warwick University.

{"User":"yellowhippo","text":"The latest addition to the Premier Inn estate in the Coventry area is in one of the most iconic buildings in the City, which has been instrumental in shaping the lives of literally thousands of its citizens. The hotel has refurbished part of the old Coventry Technical College Building whose foundation stone was laid by King Edward V111 when still Prince of Wales and which was opened by George V1. The refurbishment has been done to a high specification and the room that I stayed in on only the 4th night it was open was spacious and comfy and obviously Premier Inn. The bar and restaurant were also decorated very pleasantly and I personally preferred these to the Belgrade Plaza Premier Inn. There weren't many customers due to it being opened so recently but a large number of people just popped in to see the adaptations because the hoarding had come down and these were mainly ex employees or students. Indeed the whole reason that we had gone was because my husband had been a senior manager at the college. He found it hard to remember exactly what had been where due to the work carried out. It was mainly the windows that helped him place where he was. We had the Meal Deal which is excellent value for money and plently of choice. In the morning the breakfast was excellent and due to limited number of guests was cooked to order, it would normally be a buffet. All staff both in the evening and the morning were excellent, very pleasant, very customer focussed and very positive about working in this new hotel, which they saw as an exciting new opportunity for all. As I have said it is a brand new building but it is situated in an excellent position. The other part of the College building will hopefully be turned into retail outlets and the attached theatre will hopefully reopen later in the year. The hotel is excellently situated for both Coventry Rugby Club and the Ice Hockey Team. It is a 5 minute walk to the city centre and if you want to go out of the hotel for a meal, there are several good restaurants situated locally. I was very impressed and will visit again, even though I live locally","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Location":"Midlands","Helpful":0,"date":"8 February 2012","sleepQ":4,"Cities":0,"title":"\u201cWhat a transformation!!\u201d","Reviews":0,"value":5,"service":5,"cleanliness":5,"rating":5,"rooms":5}
