We were offered a choice of rooms as there was 2 available and chose the one on the top floor with a four poster bed. Wow what a fabulous room!!! In fact the whole house is beautiful, and is furnished to a very high standard with some wonderful antiques. Later my nephew who lives nearby called in to see if we had arrived ok. Anita came to our room to inform us that we had a visitor and then she promptly made a pot of tea for us all which was brought to us in longe. Later that evening I popped downstairs to see if they had a number for a local taxi and was told that if we came down when we were ready Anita would call one and we could have a glass of wine whilst we were waiting. Breakfast was fantastic and the overall service could not have been better. I would definitely recommend this guesthouse and will almost certainly visit again when I'm next in the area.

She booked The Villas Residence for one night & it was absolutely the right decision. We were met by the owner, Paul, who greeted us & looked after us more like family than paying guests. As we were the first guests to arrive on the Saturday afternoon so Paul showed us around the rooms and let us make the choice. We chose the Victorian room, which overlooked he front gardens. It was a good size, well furnished with great light. It's not en suite but the bathroom which is right next door is beautifully & expensively equipped so it's no hardship at all. My wife had a great soak in the Jacuzzi bath as we prepared to go out for dinner. Before we left the hotel for Nutters, we had a very pleasant glass of wine with the other guests in the very comfortable sitting room. Overnight, we had a great sleep in the huge, ornate bed. The linen was possibly the crispest I've ever slept in and made for a very comfortable night. Breakfast, the next morning, was made to order and was most excellent. The staff were polite, discreet, interested & attentive & nothing was too much trouble. Overall, this was a great experience & we would not hesitate to return or recommend it to others. Congratulations to Paul & his team for creating an oasis of tranquility & refinement in an increasingly hectic world.

Very small. intimate. Rooms are like an Aladdin's cave. So unique. Great furnishings. Antiques everywhere. So warm. So welcoming. I don't think I have come across rooms of this high standard anywhere. Real attention to detail. This is a real hidden gem. I am amazed at the price. Unbelievable value for money. The host/manager cannot do enough for you.Shared a glass of wine with him and had a good chat. Every hotel should be like this. This really does set the standard for others to follow. Blown away by my experience. Town centre just a couple of minutes walk but you feel like you are in the middle of nowhere. If money was no object, this is how I would have my house. Love it. Will be back time and time again. If you need a hotel in Rochdale, honestly, don't look any further. Tried the rest. This is head and shoulders above the rest. Room Tip: All amazing and truly unique.

The house is a fantastically well converted period property with spacious rooms, high ceilings and endless original features. It's been very stylishly but sympathetically decorated with some lovely pieces and lots of well-placed details in each room. This gives it a classy show home, or magazine shoot feel, but without any pretension - still a very relaxing place despite having a sense of occasion. There are 6 bespoke rooms, each with its own unique style; we stayed in the front room that has a Chinese/Asian theme, and came with lots of interesting antiquities and pieces to admire. Our room was en-suite with a large and super comfy bed and lovely duvet and pillows. We also had the option to take the room in the attic which had a beautiful antique four poster bed and its own bathroom with a very nice roll-top bath. The owner Paul was very relaxed and welcoming and we were invited to pop down for a glass of wine if we fancied it. Paul supplied the wine and we had an interesting time interrogating him on the story behind the house. Thanks to work, I've stayed in all sorts of hotels in lots of countries and I'm always looking for places like this - it's a real gem. We'll definitely stay here again at some point, probably with friends as a birthday celebration at Nutters restaurant along with another pamper at the day spa - obviously.","title":"\u201cBeautiful and relaxing place\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":3,"Reviews":1,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Altrincham, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"17 February 2013","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}{"User":"Nikki_P216","Cities":0,"text":"We stayed here for a night while visiting friends and from the moment of our arrival, Paul was incredibly friendly and welcoming.

As usual we were going to 'Nutters' restaurant, this time for their 'Burn's Night' celebrations. Paul as usual greeted us warmly and we were immediately 'at home.' After a drink and catch up we went to get ready and Paul ordered a taxi to take us to the restaurant. The weather really lived up to the theme of 'Burn's Night' and we had extremely heavy snow. In fact there was a point when we thought we may be unable to get back to the 'Villas.' However we needn't have worried Paul made sure we got back and was even waiting up to let us in! The room we had was the one with a four-poster bed so were we glad to end up sleeping in it!! As always everything was excellent and of the highest standard. Breakfast was lovely with all the extra touches that make it special. Whilst we were eating and getting ready to go, our host was busy clearing snow from the driveway so that we could get our cars out! Our friends were equally impressed, and hopefully we shall all be returning in the not too distant future, but with better weather!! Helen and Peter.
