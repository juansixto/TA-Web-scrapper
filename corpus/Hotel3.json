{"User":"OnGlide","Cities":0,"text":"Good points first - friendly staff, nice food. Bad points: - When booking, the picture of the hotel looks great. At £98 per night room only, you'd think you'd be staying in the main building but you're actually put up in the annex which is a walk to/from the hotel ameneties. So, rather misleading. - My room on the 2nd floor of the annex was basically a cell with no window (it had a tiny window in the eaves, you had to stand up and walk right up to it to get any view - awful). - No free internet, £9.99 per day for BT Openzone - £17.50 for breakfast? Are you kidding? A lot of business travellers just want a light bite. Fancy having breakfast in your room? That'll be another £3 'tray charge' - probably because it's a schlep from the main hotel to your 'cell'. - £3 fee for settling by credit card. Come on, really? - No newspapers to read in the bar. - No real ales in the bar, hopeless. Only usual lagers/John Smiths on taps, everything else in cans/bottles. Pricey drinks, as expected. Overall, a real disappointment and one that motivated me to join TripAdvisor to leave a comment. I stayed on business after hearing good things about Macdonald Hotels from my folks, but I wouldn't stay again. It is clear that the owners are trying to squeeze out every penny of revenue from the hotel, which left me feeling ripped off (and misled from the website).","title":"\u201cDissapointing penny-pinching\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Reviews":1,"service":3,"value":2,"Location":"London, United Kingdom","cleanliness":3,"Helpful":0,"date":"30 April 2013 NEW","sleepQ":3,"rooms":1}

A tip when you arrive, leave your bags in the car before you check in, mostly likely you'll be in the annexe near the car park. My room (in the annexe..!) was cold when I arrived but did soon warm up when I worked out the heating. room was spacious, well furnished and clean with a lovely bathroom. Meeting with a colleague in the bar was fine, service attentive and we decided to eat there as well. Menu was limited but food was served quickly and was very good. I should add, the hotel was not at all busy...for most of the time, about 3 hours, we were the only people in the bar. I slept well, bed was comfortabe. On entering the breakfast room I was met by an engaging lady and shown to a table and tea/toast order was taken. after my evening meal I only wanted a light breakfast, cereal/toast, so was shocked to see no \"Continental\" option and a price tag of £17.50....! This is ridiculous....The full breakfast looked very good (on adjacent guests' plate) and I suppose if you were very hungry you could get value for money but why not offer a Continental option.? I mentioned this at checkout, the friendly receptionist said she'd mention it, at the same time as charging me £3 for using a credit card.....Why do quality hotels feel they need to charge for things like this, wifi is the other stealth charge....really annoys me and will make me reluctant to stay again....

Comfortable bed, clean linen comfortable pillows (non-alergenic, non-feather, on request). The kettle and tea/coffee in the room was most welcome.

Cost was around £60 for the room and £17.50 for breakfast- bit odd I thought, but hey ho came in under budget, so went for it. The hotel itself is nice enough, as are the staff but what really got my goat was the price structure and hidden charges. Examples: £6.95 for a half pint bottle of Innes and Gun (beer)- this is £1.50 a bottle at my local supermarket. Ok I expect to pay more in a hotel, but this works out at £14 a pint!! Crazy! Decided on room service for the 2 nights after seeing the restaurant prices, only to be stung for a £3 tray charge each night- surely this should be included in the room service menu price!? Breakfast: £17.50 each morning, but get this- if you want a fish dish instead of the standard English...£2.50 supplement- so £20 for a plate of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs !!?? To top it all, on checkout, I noticed a £1 charity charge on my bill. Ok its only £1, but I had not consented to this and as a business user I cant claim it back. I was also then asked if I was paying by credit or debit card. Who pays with a debit card???? Another £3 added to my bill for the credit card transaction!

Room was in an annex which meant leaving the main part of the hotel, accessing via a potholed, muddy gravel path. Room was worn and shabby, with noticeable worn patches in the carpet. I'm not really impressed at having to put on a coat (and recross the muddy gravel path) to go for dinner; even less impressed by the lacklustre menu and a waiter who couldn't even describe the 'soup of the day'. I went for the steak - as did my colleague - and we were totally underwhlemed at the miniscule slice of meat - must have been all of 3 ozs - and a few handcut chips that demanded a close to £20 price tag. His reminder to the waiter that he had ordered it with a sauce was met with the question - 'Red or Brown'. He gave up. Coffee? Ah, the 'machine had broken down' and eventually a couple of slow pouring cafetieres were rustled up. The coffee, itself, it has to be said was passable and probably the only high point of the evening. Final insult was a £3.00 surcharge for using my credit card - thankfully a corporate one - to settle my bill. Having travelled for many years, in international setting and having stayed at varying qualities of hotel, I can honestly say - without fear of contradiction - that the Macdonald Ansty Hall is beyond doubt the worst hotel I have ever had to stay in.

{"User":"Lolligeorge","Cities":6,"text":"Wanted to enjoy a luxurious weekend break with my husband. On arrival first impressions were good, although a wedding was taking place (the in between part) we were booked in quite swiftly alongside a rather rude couple! But I had booked a classic room not realising it was in a separate part of the main house. (Stopford annexe) But wasn't too fussed until we walked into the room, it was like a cousin of a premier inn room, and in fact premier inn rooms were nicer than this. The curtains were closed which wasn't a nice first impression the room had a funny smell and the bed linen had a worrying sticky patch- I wasn't happy at all. My husband went back to reception to complain. We were quickly dealt with, although we had to pay extra we were moved to a feature room. This was much nicer, although there were a couple of stains on the armchairs we were quite happy. But the matresss definitely needs upgrading unless guests you like soft mattresses and pillows, which we certainly do not and in fact both our backs hurt the following day. Had a lovely walk around the grounds, although there are many pot holes along the roads. Had some food in the Shilton restaurant on the first night, this was most impressive although very expensive, the staff were particularly pleasant especially the friendly waitress and matrie'd. At breakfast we met the same staff on as the night before, and you could not fault the service again or the delicious breakfast- definitely this side of the restaurant needs no development. Second day after a tiring day out we were looking forward to relaxing in our room and surprised to hear and see all the cleaning staff around at 5pm with all the equipment in the corridors, but they were very loud! Chatting overly loud and banging doors and cupboards, which disturbed our atmosphere. Overall our advice would be to avoid the stopford annexe as guests and for the hotel to seriously update these rooms, also avoid buying drinks in the overpriced bar, certainly not worth it, take your own! Try the restaurant if you can afford it as the food was wonderful, but there is a nearby pub which we are going to try later! Room Tip: Avoid the Stopford rooms at all cost!!!!

After parking we carried our case back to reception (you can't pull a wheeled case on this ground) and checked in. Our room was in a separate building to the main hotel, so back outside, avoiding puddles and mud to our room. The room was clean and spacious, the bed was very comfortable.

I went to the bar and asked had I understood correctly or should I still be waiting in the lounge? After some thought she told me to return to my seat and she would send somebody, OK 8 mins later a kid arrived and took our drinks order. 2 campari sodas served in a half pint glass, so much soda that you weren't sure if they had actually remembered to put the Campari in or not, a gin and tonic - no ice or lemon, having plonked them on the table, he returned with 4 beer mats and put them in the middle of the table, and kindly advised us these were our beer mats !! I asked if we could see some menus, a young waiter arrived, more mud on his shoes than I have on my dog-walking wellies !! He proceeded to give me 3 menus, I pointed out that there was four of us !! It didn,t sink in that we might need another menu. Having looked at the Menu (far from ala carte! but a set Sunday evening meal) I decided enough was enough, and we paid for the drinks and went to THE BELL at Monks Kirby, Incredible meal was then had by all.

There were four of us and we paid £149 each which included 6 course dinner, entertainment, overnight accomodation and full English breakfast. Service was great, lots of canapés and more than one glass of champagne. Drinks prices average for a hotel. A fixed set meal which was not everyone's choice so a couple of options would have improved it. Room was clean, pleasant and had everything we needed. The only other minor complaint would be that the entertainment was a bit loud for us and there isn't another room around the orangery to get away from the music and talk.

We arrived in torrential rain and the car park - which is not tarmacced - was a complete mudbath. It was impossible to pull a wheely case along through the stones and mud. A dreadful start. A hotel of this standard can surely afford a decent car park? Not much better with no rail up to the front door to get up the stairs. There's no lift - steep staircase with NO rail. I have a slight walking disability and really struggled on these stairs. Our room was quite nice with a comfy bed and well furnished. However, the toilet didn't flush properly which is a real nightmare. The towels were a bit hard and not fluffy as was the provided dressing gown which was much too hard to use in comfort. The so-called 'prawn cocktail' was a tasteless affair of shrimps passed off as prawns with no proper Marie Rose sauce. Possibly the worst prawn cocktail I've had in my life. The salmon en croute was soggy and the Bailey's torte was devoid of Baileys. The room where we had the conference had lots of hunting paintings in - not my favourite subject. This was a business trip and not paid for my me so maybe I shouldn't complain.....but if I had been paying for it myself I would not be at all impressed. Would I stay here again?

Hotel service quirky and food is overall good. My second stay here - grnd floor side room was a bit stuffy smelling and dark, first floor room better (and with mobile hone signal) . The main problem with the hotel is the simply awful car park that is not well maintained and means if it rains you will get very wet and muddy feet in trying to battle your way to find the courtyard suits.

Nicely decorated, the Merlot quite acidic, not mellow. A tomato and basil soup to start, tasted very strong and tinned, no sign of any puree which I would expect in kitchen made. Beef for main, one guest said this place famed for its beef! Bit disappointed as it did truly taste reheated and the 'homemade' yorkie was definitely soft, not crispy. The lemon posset with mascerated strawberries was nicely tart/sweet, best bit of the menu. Tea, coffee and mints with what tasted kitchen made dusted chocolate bonbon on top was a nice surprise. The staff were all just fine. As others have said the bar is pricy, coffee for two was around £9.00 but we did get two average cups each and cream too. The location and view are rather nice but badly let down by a dangerous car park full of large dips, quite a trip hazzard. Relieved we visited daytime and could see where we walked to avoid falling.

I just wish I could have spent more time in it, but we were in the UK to visit friends, so spent more time outside of the hotel than in it. The bathroom was also on the small size and if I have one complaint it is that the shower water pressure wasn't great. We ate breakfast in the restaurant twice and I have to say that the \"Signature\" breakfast is one of the best cooked breakfasts I have had anywhere. Not to be missed! The restaurant service was also first class. If I have one negative comment to make about the hotel in general it is the lack of complementary WiFi. Access to WiFi could be obtained by purchasing an online subscription to BT Opensource, or by buying a voucher from the hotel reception for ten pounds, which I did, but even then I could not access WiFi in the bedroom or restaurant.

We decided to leave our rooms as they were, and proceeded to go to the bar prior to having dinner in the Shilton restaurant. We got some pre dinner drinks at the bar and were horrified to be charged £8 for a (not very large) glass of wine, and £5 for a standard bottle of magners! The meal was \"so-so\" and there was a distinct lack of waiting staff. Service was very slow, and I felt I had to constantly prompt the waitress to serve us. Our food was also very slow indeed and when the mains finally arrived, my poor brother's order hadn't even been passed onto the kitchen and he had to watch us eat for another 10mins. Even though the waitress apologised profusely, it was embarrassing and NOT the relaxing experience I'd expected or hoped for. The quality of the meals was also variable, though my ravioli was lovely. The next day, we had out pre-arranged big family meal, and this went far more smoothly, but again, when we all went through to the room, I had to let the waitress know there should have been wine on the tables. The whole weekend, I felt I had to chivvy things along, and the lack of staff made everything rather slow and uncertain.

These are generally held in the separate function suite so there is little disturbance to the rest of the Hotel. Food is very good - especially breakfasts where there is a great selection. Drinks rather pricey.

{"User":"Missus1","Cities":8,"text":"I'm sitting writing this review in the beautiful gardens of Ansty Hall. A lovely hotel in the village of Ansty in Coventry. I have to say this is one of the most friendly, welcoming hotels I have stayed in. The staff cannot do enough for you. They are atune with guests needs and requirements without being obvious, a sign of good training and nurturing management; indeed quite a few staff have been at the Hall for several years. The rooms are clean, well looked after and there are plenty of public areas to sit and relax. We only ate in the dining room on one night and the meal was good but to my mind not seasonal - I hasten to add this is no reflection on the standard of cooking and presentation but of a catering decision further up the chain I'd guess. The breakfasts were outstanding with plenty of choices and hot dishes cooked to order and here again the staff were wonderful. I noticed in a previous review comment on needing a taxi to get into Coventry centre. The 74 bus runs from just outside the Rose and Crown pub (good food there by the way) just down from the hotel; admittedly on a limited service but frequent enough to allow a day in the city without resorting to a taxi, which is about £12-14 each way. If you like to stay in relaxing surroundings with comfortable rooms and lovely gardens then this is the place for you in Coventry. Would I visit Ansty Hall again?, a resounding yes.

I too, was a little disappointed with the evening meal. It was well presented and the fresh bread was lovely. I enjoyed my starter, however, my main was a little salty and the dessert was not the \"cheesecake\" I expected. My husband seemed happy with his choice though. We had a bottle of wine with dinner which was slighly on the expensive side. We stayed here after my husband had his \"driving experience\" at Mallory Park and visited Warwick Castle the next day.

{"User":"hughy66","Cities":4,"text":"Booked this hotel as a birthday treat on DBB in an executive room for 2 at £138. The hotel is a lovely peaceful place to stay with character in keeping with the building. The staff are superb with a warm friendly and professional manner. The room was superb and well fitted out. However there are a few negatives including finding hair in 3 separate places in the bathroom, Pre dinner drink prices are daylight robbery just under £20 for 2 mojito cocktails !! Evening meal was a little bit of a let-down very limited and after speaking to 2 other guests the menu is exactly the same every night. The starter of smoked haddock fritter with chilli and pea and mint puree looked appetising but was very bland and not a good start to the meal, both main courses of organic salmon and corn fed chicken was a much better offering but the baked cheesecake again failed to tickle the taste buds which is disappointing for a 1 rosette establishment. Breakfast however was exceptional. as a trainer/assessor in the hospitality trade I try to give a balanced opinion and overall I thought this hotel was relatively good value for money but with a few tweaks here and there and a review of bar tariffs I would have rated it 5 and superb value for money. But must say once again the staff are a credit to the hotel trade they get 5 stars. Room Tip: Book the executive room as worth the extra cost.

{"User":"ClaireNZ2012","Cities":14,"text":"Our arrival was greeted by a formal and polite lady at reception. I guess she did all she needed to, but her lines seemed rehearsed and she wasn't at all welcoming. She did not offer any advice on what to do in the area, their restaurant, the gardens or anything. We were not offered a suitcase delivery, even though the building we had to go to was across gravel and in the rain to another building (we had to ask, but in the end our biggest bag was delivered for us). We assumed this may have been a typical formal and upmarket English reception, but I felt a little awkward. We were to stay 2 nights. The weather was appalling but of course that could not be helped. It did mean we could not fully explore the property, especially the acres of landscaped gardens advertised (we did not even see them). We stayed in a modern wing to the side of the main reception building. It was not easy to find the door to, despite brief instructions from the receptionist. It was raining and cold, and I think it would have been nice to have someone show us to the room. The room was a pleasant surprise, very large, with a full bath and a shower over the bath. View over the carpark - nothing special. Large bathroom, large, firm bed. Brilliant curtains which completely shut out the light (which was good because I'd been having problems staying asleep with the early sunrises). Unfortunately for this review, I was struck what I believe was food poisoning from a local pub. The food was nice, but at about 2am on our first night in Ansty it all started to go wrong. This meant I could not enjoy the well-reviewed breakfast at the hotel, though since my husband was fine, he went and he said it was great. I gave the hotel 4 stars. The last star was lost on the chilly receptionist, and the fact we had to walk by ourselves in the rain with all bar one of our bags, trying to find a door to a building we did not know. The room was great and I would have liked to enjoy the luxury for longer and waited for the rain to stop.","title":"\u201cFormal, quiet, large rooms\u201d","hotelReviews":12,"location":4,"Reviews":23,"service":3,"value":4,"Location":"Auckland Region, New Zealand","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":6,"date":"4 July 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"apgaylard","Cities":29,"text":"I recently had a couple of nights here; and have stayed here before. This is a charming small country house hotel with a lovely garden. It's a very popular wedding venue - so expect there to be one on if your stay is a summer weekend.  This was a bit of an issue as poor weather lead to the hotel's public areas being overwhelmed with wedding guests. Once they were taken through into a large dining room the issue dissipated. Our check-in was friendly and efficient. We had a spacious room in the annexe: clean, comfortable and well-appointed. The staff are a bit variable, raining from the exceptional to disinterested and rude. As we needed to be out early at the weekend the hotel were kind enough to open for breakfast 1/2 early, at 0730 (breakfast at the weekend starts at 0800, which is a bit late). That was really good of them, however, on the second morning the staff were clearly annoyed with us for not ordering cooked items. That's a bit off, I know they made a special effort, but when we got up we found one of our party unwell, ourselves fairly full from the previous night's meal and dilatory service also ran us a bit short on time.  At relatively pricey 4 star hotel I expect to be treated with courtesy and respect,  even when I may put staff out a little. I don't expect friends who were down later to overhear staff being critical of me. Having said that, the cooked breakfast items we enjoyed on our first morning were excellent. Very high quality ingredients. We had two meals in the intimate Shilton Restaurant. Generally the food and service was very good. The Maitre d' is particularly helpful. During our stay we had excellent smoked salmon, beef shin and lamb. There were some issues: the very late delivery of a dessert on the first night and rib-eye steaks cooked well done rather than the merequester, as requested.  To be frank: the steaks were a bit thin and lacked flavour. I've had better at my local pub. We did get a free bottle of wine to compensate though. The wine cellar here is very good, containing some real gems. I really want to like this place more than the experience permits. There are some staff here who try really hard to provide a good customer experience; much of the food offering is excellent. However, the hotel is too small and tired to live up to its ambitions. There is a tendency for some staff to lose customer focus and others don't seem interested in customer service. The overall impression given is of a slightly pretentious hotel that doesn't live up to its promise.","title":"\u201cA Curate's Egg: good in parts\u201d","hotelReviews":18,"location":4,"Reviews":53,"service":2,"value":2,"Location":"England","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":20,"date":"23 June 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":4}

The room was gorgeous, with a very comfortable bed and stylish decor. I remembered the decor in some of the communal areas but even after the passage of time the hotel didn't look tired. I am not sure how they manage this - either guests are particularly well-behaved or the hotel is particularly diligent about ongoing maintenance to keep things in order.

From the moment we arrived at the hotel we were treated with the utmost courtesy. Everyone was so friendly and went that extra mile to ensure we had a fabulous weekend (the company was also fantastic). We all had a bar meal consisting of a sandwich and a half, crisps and a side salad with dressing and a few drinks (the bill was carried over until the evening). We decided to take a stroll around the grounds, the rabbits were running over the grass, the sun was shining down on us, and the views around the hotel were just perfect. Then it was back to the rooms to get ready for the evening meal. The first thing that greeted you as you walked into the rooms, was the smell of cleanliness, the rooms were furnished to a high standard and there was everything you could possibly need for an overnight stay i.e. trouser press, hairdryer, TV etc. In the bathroom there was a shower and a bath and was fitted out to a high standard. The evening meal was superb and the head waiter (who came from Rome) and the waitress were so attentive and couldn't do enough for us. Even when they were attempting to tidy the restaurant after the diners (we were dragging our feet a little) didn't detract from their courtesy. The same at breakfast, the banter from the Head waiter was so relaxing (there was not one member of staff that was a stuffed shirt, everyone was willing to have a laugh). The breakfast, you were definitely spoilt for choice. There were pastries, fresh fruit, fruit salad, yoghurt and cereals and then a full English (MMMMMM memories). If you would like a fantastic reasonably priced weekend, with good company, excellent service and food and attentive staff. Go to the MacDonald Ansty Hall.

A lovely touch we thought. The Annexe was lovely and very secure, with a pass card needed not only for the room but also for entering the building itself. I was a disabled guest and the facilities were great. The rooms were really nice and big and the beds were so comfy we didnt want to get up the next morning. The food was exceptional and the service was splendid. Nothing was to much trouble and the staff were very polite and respectful. Our party ranged from 40years old to 83years old and we couldn't find fault with anything. One thing inparticular that stood out was at the end of the evening a member of staff escourted the older members of our party to the annexe and made sure they got to their rooms ok, while the rest of us stayed in the bar. Breakfast was also exceptional, and again nothing was to much trouble as some didn't want full breakfasts but it was no problem to just say what you wanted and it was done freshly for you.

First of all we happened to have a freakishly hot day which put everyone in a good mood straight away. From the moment I arrived to the moment I left I was treated like absolute royalty. Elio was absolutely fantastic and had his eye on everything. I arrived to him sweetly calming me and telling me how lovely I looked. Once we said our vows and the service had finished he took us straight away fromk everyone else and told us o spend a few moments together with our champagne and strawberries to savour the moment. We went for a drive and returned to all our guests on the patio in the grounds enjoying the champagne and sunshine. There is the most beautiful oak tree in the grounds with a bench under which was a photo must. As I was walking over to it I realised the stone bench was a bit mucky, before I could say anything Elio was there with a cloth to cover it for me. He conducted the day perfectly, rounded us up when dinner was served and put my family and in laws in the correct order for the line up. Everything just flowed and if I noticed anything he had already sorted it before I could mention it. The food was absolutely superb and Elio and his staff bought out extras for anyone who wanted it, he even insisted extra roast potatoes on the top table even when we said no :-) they all got eaten though. Elio and all his team were personable but not invasive. The hotel, the staff, the grounds, the food was all above expectations!! I used to plan events and weddings to have a very critical eye - but there was absolutely nothing to criticise!! It really was the wedding of mine and my husbands dreams and I cant thank all the team at Ansty Hall for giving me such a wonderful memory which I will carry with me for the rest of my life.

Our Valentine themed dinner was superb and the Italian gentleman ( I didn't catch his name) was first class in service and making guests feel special. Karolina our waitress for dinner and breakfast was exceptional. The only thing I was disappointed in is the toilettries have changed from Arran.

{"User":"Katy D","Cities":3,"text":"My boyfriend and I got a fairly cheap deal for dinner bed and breakfast at Ansty Hall. My initial impressions were very good, the hotel is very beautiful and the receptionist who booked us in was very friendly indeed. We went up to our room which was also lovely and decided to head back down for a cup of tea. The bar area was open and we ordered a cream tea to share. The cream tea was lovely, although at £9 for 2 scones, perhaps slightly expensive! The bar area was very pleasant, only slightly spoiled by the events planner sitting in the area booking a wedding in with a couple; for some reason the planner seemed to feel the need to bellow at the couple, despite the fact that they were sitting next to her. Whether they wanted me to hear the intimate details of their wedding I don't know but I certainly do know what their every movements will be when their big day comes round! We ate in the dining room at the hotel for our evening meal which I thought was fairly pleasant but really not amazing. There was nothing explicitly wrong with the food it just didn't really have anything particularly outstanding about it. Our room was very quiet and the bed very comfy, so no complaints at all there. My biggest problem emerged at breakfast. Being a big fan of eggs benedict I was pleased to see that it was part of the breakfast menu for a supplement of £2.50. When they came, however, there was no hollandaise sauce! So essentially I had paid an additional £2.50 for a poached egg with bacon on a muffin! I told the waiter that I wanted to send it back and he took it back to the kitchen. Unfortunately, the door to the kitchen is not as thick as the cooking staff clearly think it is so I could hear them complaining that I had returned the offending eggs! I would suggest that they might consider checking the component aspects of a dish before including it on the menu.... As I say, the hotel itself is lovely but I would suggest not bothering with the food and would probably advise the staff that they may like to keep their comments to themselves while they can potentially be overheard by the guests.","title":"\u201cLovely hotel, shame about the food\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":3,"Reviews":4,"service":3,"value":3,"Location":"Oxford","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":4,"date":"26 January 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":4}
{"User":"soundbites30","Cities":21,"text":"I stayed here on a business trip and got to experience most of the hotel facilities, the check in was smooth with reception having a roaring fire as you walk in, the only disappointment was that my room was in the annex rather than the main hotel. That said the room was a good size and well appointed with all the usual things like tea/coffee facilities, iron & ironing board for example, but being on the ground floor and on the pathway it meant you felt your privacy was slightly compromised. The cleanliness of the room was ok but nothing to write home about and the heating difficult to fathom. That said the bed was very comfortable. I ate in the restaurant in the evening and had a 3 course meal that the business had paid for, the starter was a very disappointing vegetable ratatouie, the main was a posh roast with absolutely delicious beef & finally the pudding which was the best thing was a wonderful creme brulee. After the evening meal I relaxed in the bar which was very pleasant with plenty of comfortable seating. I decided to have breakfast served in my room and placed my order on the card with the time I wanted it delivering and hung it on my door, the breakfast was duly delivered on time and the tray charge was a reasonable £3.00. The breakfast which was a full english with toast & jam and had orange juice & coffee was hot on arrival and very tasty, my only comment is it needed a sauce with the cooked breakfast whether brown or tomato. Finally I spent most of the day in a meeting in the Orangery with tea/coffee facilities and some lovely cake & shortcake for snacks, for lunch which I felt was the best meal I had various buffet style food but there was lovely small ramakins of Salmon Pie & Hot Pot with a good Berry Crumble for afters.

Even though not cold weather the room could have been warmer. Bathroom half refurbished. Reading any of my other reports it will been seen that I have an annoyance with the hotel handy man\u2019s liberal use of bathroom sealant. Dinner was OK. Shortage of canapés. Rationed to two. The beef was overcooked and there was a shortage of vegetables. I saw the same sweet in a motorway café on the way home. Breakfast in MacDonalds is a treat. Long menu card and usually not a buffet. They make a fantastic porridge. This year buffet. No menu card and the porridge lumpy. No major problem or complaint with our excellent stay \u2013 but again BUT\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Room Tip: Try to have a roo in the main building - feels more special See more room tips","title":"\u201cCan't put my finger on it\u201d","hotelReviews":6,"location":5,"Reviews":7,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Essex","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":3,"date":"1 January 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":3}

If I had paid the full price I would have been quite disappointed. The sandwiches (ham, cucumber and smoked salmon) were entirely plain with no dressing etc and had some crust attached. We had one scone each, quite nice, but served with lemon curd as well as raspberry jam which was a bit odd. The cakes were ok, but two were heavy fruit cake. We had to ask the waitress for darjeeling tea as she seemed unaware of anything other than English breakfast.

Room 35 - top notch, must have been recently refurbed as it was in excellent condition, bathroom was spotless.

Even when we asked them if they would be able to bring the wedding breakfast forward by 45mins it was not even suggested it would be of any trouble. They all appeared calm & efficient throughout. Not to forget to mention the service manager who helped us the night before the wedding to arrange the room to our liking & made breakfast the day after the wedding an easy a pleasurable experience for a large table of people all eating at the same time. The food for the wedding breakfast was amazing all courses cooked to a very high standard, a great choice. To top of a fantastic three course dinner, handmade chocolate truffles were placed in abbundace on the tables which were the most delicious chocolates we have ever tasted.

She was cheerful and welcoming as well as very efficient. She, as did all the staff, remember our names, and even remembered that my son loved the delicious warm croissants and bought him one every morning.

{"User":"PH1981","Cities":0,"text":"The hotel is without doubt a grand venue and ideal for weddings. The room was larger than i expected, as i had booked a 'double room for single occupancy' which was clearly a standard double. Double bed, en suite, armchairs, etc etc. The first thing i did when i got in was open the window, the latch to which was broken. I wasn't concerned with security but the loose, rattling window contributed to the general lack of soundproofing. I could hear every car door closing from the overlooked car park on one side, and every word of conversation from passers by on the corridor outside the room. The room was otherwise very comfortable and could easily accommodate a couple with infant. The aspect that annoyed me was the lack of guidance from staff. The signage and layout does not make navigation easy, and i wasn't the only one looking bewildered when faced with initially finding the accommodation area and taking breakfast. I am by no means a seasoned traveller, but I have come to expect the breakfast experience to be a stress-free, straight forward affair. You enter the room and it's obvious what to do, be it grab a tray/plate and help yourself or request from the staff. I naively expected to be offered toast and tea/coffee on arrival (at the beginning of the 60-minute slot allocated to wedding guests), since this was not available on a 'help yourself' basis. However, we had to specifically ask for it after having been seated for about 10 minutes. Cue awkwardness and embarrassment. Also I had to use my debit card for all (expensive) transactions at the bar because the receptionist and bar staff were seemingly unable to activate the system to allow a room tab. So overall, a grand venue but not the most user-friendly experience.","title":"\u201cBeautiful but not user-friendly\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":0,"Reviews":1,"service":2,"value":3,"Location":"Leicester, United Kingdom","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":0,"date":"14 August 2011","sleepQ":4,"rooms":0}

The exterior of the main building is very pretty and even though they have added a modern conversion on the side, this can't really be seen from the front. The gardens at the back are beautiful and the lawns look immaculate, I can see why people choose it as a wedding venue. We were lucky enough to be in the main part of the house. The room was fairly large with a huge comfy bed. The bathroom was a decent size, however there did seem to be a shortage of towels (although there was a bathrobe). Breakfast was a good hearty full english with a good selection. Room rates seemed to vary considerably but I did notice that on some websites you could get some great last minute deals, if you were willing to wait. Overall its a good hotel for a romantic weekend away or a entertainment venue.","title":"\u201cLovely setting, ideal for a wedding or a romantic weekend away\u201d","hotelReviews":54,"location":0,"Reviews":619,"service":4,"value":4,"Location":"Hertfordshire, England","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":788,"date":"6 August 2011","sleepQ":4,"rooms":0}

The wedding meal was great, hot and tasty, but the bar prices were nothing short of extortion. £6 for two diet cokes, £3.70 for a cup of tea, one round of 6 drinks was £42.

The receptionist was very polite and helpful. When booking the room, I had asked for a twin room, rather than a double and this had been acknowledged as we ended up in a twin room! The room itself was quite large, however that seemed to be because we had been given one of the disabled rooms. Therefore there were a lot of extra rails, bits of string from the ceiling etc. The room was very clean and the beds were very comfy. Unfortunately the room itself was also quite dingy. It only had very small windows and not much light came through. This didn\u2019t overly bother us, as we weren\u2019t spending a lot of time in the room \u2013 however if you\u2019re looking to use the hotel for more than a \u2018place to crash\u2019 you might wish to avoid room 208 due to the very small windows. This was also a bit of a pain due to the fact that it was very hot and there wasn\u2019t any air-con so we got minimal air circulation in the room. We got a good nights sleep and the breakfast was very adequate \u2013 the service was also very good and we were seated within seconds and offered tea / coffee etc. I would stay here again, however would probably request a different room if I was going to be spending any length of time in the hotel.","title":"\u201cClean and tidy... but dingy room\u201d","hotelReviews":28,"location":0,"Reviews":43,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Berkshire","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":35,"date":"5 July 2011","sleepQ":4,"rooms":0}

The service was outstanding from everyone in the bar to the restaurant. Menus were bought to us in the bar and our orders were taken. Both the waitress and waiter paid a great attention to detail and made us feel very welcome. Breakfast was a bit busier and we were sat next to the juice bar which was very irritating after being my chair being knocked half a dozen times. Breakfast was nice although the black pudding was crunchy and inedible. As with most hotels these days, check your bill properly. They were trying to charge me another £60 odd pound for dinner. And when I said its not right, the guy said, oh yeah, I printed the bill off before I adjusted the amount! Also got charged £2 for using a credit card altough I used a debit card to pay.

He immediately sorted the situation by carrying our luggage and showing us a quick route from the annexe to the main hotel.

We have during this period had to undertake three procurement retendering reviews of our contract to see if any other hotel can offer us a better value deal, but each time we have returned to Ansty. The mains reasons are that: 1. The team really try to meet our every need. Joyce, Tim, Jeanie, Marie -anna are all so attentive. In addition they have a number of younger members who are being schooled in very simple skills such as engagement and the understanding that we are there to work and do not want to have interruptions that disturb the flow of work. 2.

Wedding guests are served their breakfast else where so the other hotel guests do not get a poorer service - a great solution! Food at dinner was delicious - don't be put off by the simple menu the quality is superb!

The food was fantastic and the breakfast was particularly good.

{"User":"lil-miss-sunshine","Cities":32,"text":"We stayed at Ansty Hall for one night over the Easter Weekend, we were celebrating our wedding aniversary. The hotel is set in lovely grounds. We were greeted by a very friendly receptionist & checked in swiftly. We were in a classic room in the annexe, our room was great, very large & incredibly comfortable. There was a huge bed, sofa & work desk & flat screen t.v. One slight issue was the room only had a very small window at the top of the wall so you couldnt really see out & it made the room quite dark. This would have been lovely and cozy on a winters day but the sun was blazing outisde & the room was a little dark. The bathroom was great with both a bath and shower cubicle, the shower was mega powerfull & very hot. There was an iron & ironing board in the room so dont bother packing one. We ate at the hotel & the staff were lovely, they make you feel very special & you feel its a very personal service. The food was great, I had steak & my husband had fish & we both enjoyed our meals. Breakfast was also superb, there is a buffet serving fruit, yogurts, pastries etc & also a hot breaskfast which is very well cooked & is clearly good quality produce. The drinks are quite expensive as you would expect from a 4* Hotel. £6 - £8 for a large glass of wine depending on which you choose, they also did smaller glasses at £4.50 - £6 so you can have a few glasses without breaking the bank. They had an extensive wine list. If you drink cider be warned a pint bottle of Magners is £7 which I personally think is way over the top price wise when its only £4 in the most expensive pubs - We didnt even pay that much in Dubai, lol !! We would definietly stay here again, all the staff we encountered were lovely & friendly. its quite a small hotel compared to some other country style hotels so it all feels quite personal. Its a lovely place & we would higly recomend it.","title":"\u201cGreat for a special occasion\u201d","hotelReviews":44,"location":5,"Reviews":49,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Doncaster, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":71,"date":"26 April 2011","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

The bed was by far the comfiest hotel bed I have ever had the pleasure to sleep in and finally, a hotel that offers a superking size of bed.

Our friends were in room 35 and there were kept awake by the noise from a different wedding. There is a gold course across the road which is pay and play and is a good standard, although this is unconnected to the hotel. Couple of things that stopped this being a five star review. First of all, the bar charges. £4.35 for a pint is just plain robbery. Second, reception. It took 20 minutes to check out as there is only one computer at reception and so even if there were more staff, it is unlikely that you could do anything about it.","title":"\u201cLovely Hotel - some service issues\u201d","hotelReviews":16,"location":5,"Reviews":19,"service":3,"value":3,"Location":"manchster","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":10,"date":"27 February 2011","sleepQ":4,"rooms":5}

He was friendly, knowledgeable and very passionate about the hotel which made us realise that it was the place where we wanted to get married. Elio, showed us everywhere, even the honeymoon suit where we would stay on the night of the wedding. After leaving to view other venues and not being impressed with any other we made the decision to have our wedding at Ansty Hall. Our wedding planner Lorraine was fabulous. She was extremely patient and and helpful with our wedding being very last minute. She amended changes and always was happy to help with anything we needed. Mohammed, was truly fabulous thoughout the organising, the day of the wedding and the following day. He had the challenge of setting up a projector and linking it up with sound and a laptop for a skype call from America for our best man speech. He tested this out several times prior to the wedding to ensure all went smoothly, which it did. Mohammed was fab, he provided fabulous service at the check in desk but also arranged for luggage to be moved from rooms and generally was just brilliant. We would also like to mention Lee, the general manager. He made sure the whole day ran smoothly.

The hotel is beautiful, set in lovely grounds with good accessibility to the canal for a nice walk along the tow path. The standard room was luxury for us, with a fantastic bathroom and a high standard of cleanliness. We ate at the hotel and the food was delicious. It was at this point that the quality of service at the hotel really came into play as I had an unexpected reaction to the hazelnut (clearly marked on the menu I must admit!) syrup dessert. I quickly became ill, but the service was excellent, the staff showing both concern, offering to ring the hospital, and discretion, returning our untouched tea and remaining wine to our room and refusing my partner's offer to help clean up after me :(. Further, we received no bill for the cleaning costs. This concern continued into the following morning and check out. Despite this episode the stay really was wonderful, and we enjoyed the beautiful surroundings, warm log fires and great food in the restaurant for what we felt to be a very reasonable price. We plan to return soon, but this time will probably avoid the hazelnut syrup!!","title":"\u201cFabulous Hotel with Kind and Attentive Service\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":2,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Coventry, United Kingdom","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":0,"date":"27 November 2010","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"haggaj","Cities":4,"text":"Since I made the original reservation as a treat for my wife's birthday, I broke my leg and could not access room 1 as we remembered there was no lift to it. Contacted the hotel and they rearranged a room in the annex near to the lift. Although not a good view the room was spacious and exactly the facilities needed by a temporarily disabled individual. Staff were excellent in arranging access fto the room, for dinner and breakfast. My wife is allergic to onions and garlic - chef made her sauces and adapted the dishes ordered to ensure there was no problem. Suffice it to say, dinner was excellent and enjoyed in the quiet embience of the main dinning room. Sunday breakfast was great. Even though it was busy the catering did not resort to the unattractive buffet style , instead the cooked breakfasts were done specificaaly for you. O.K we had to wait a wee while but Elio apolgised in advance and like Guinness it was worth waitng for. Our family joined us for Sunday lunch. Food for the grand children was exaclty as they wanted including extra portions of pork crackling for the girls and Yorkshire puddings [just because they fancied them]. The audults who now included vegitarian and celiac requirements were accommodated in the same efficient way as the onion and garlic allergy. Again, excellent food served in quiet surroundings at a relaxed pace. The whole family enjoyed it. Thanks again to Elio and Karolina for their attentive service. It was once we were relaxing at home [12 miles away] in the evening and we had calls form the family saying thanks for a great day thet we reallised why we keep going back to Anstey Hall.

The hotel itself has some old world charm and has a new building just off the main hotel which has a new feel cloaked in an old 'coach house' style. When we first stayed at the hotel there was wedding in a separate building which overspilled slightly into the main hotel, the guests were unfortunately discourteous and a little drunk keeping us awake for most of the evening. The hotel manager invited us to stay again and located a quieter room on the first floor which was perfect for us, as a disabled wheelchair user the room was very spacious. We would advise future guests to ask if there is a wedding on and if unavoidable ask for a quieter room.

{"User":"MrsFab2009","Cities":2,"text":"We stayed at ansty for a friends wedding, I thought the hotel was ok, staff were helpful and our rooms were big. Our only problem was that the drinks were very expensive (about £10 for a spirit and pint) so we soon ran out of cash and needed to put our bar bill on the room. Needless to say I checked our bill carefully at check out and discovered a £50 charge for cleaning vomit from our room. Neither myself or my husband had been ill and we certainly did not call for anyone to clean in our room. I told them this, and was told that a female guest had reported hearing someone vomitting in our room at 1.30am and housekeeping came and cleared it up! I was asleep and my husband was in the bar with friends! I told the receptionist to go to the room as there was no smell of vomit in our room and to see for himself. He went and came back with a stern looking housekeeper and said there is a stain on the carpet and the room did in fact smell if vomit!!! I was appalled and offended! 100% this did NOT happen and I can only think this may be a scam to get extra money. He took the charge off after I argued with him and said there will be an investigation with the general manager. I have never felt so disgusted and angry at such a scam, with the hotel blatently lying. There was a stain outside our bathroom on the carpet, which I noticed in arrival, but unfortunately did not report. Maybe this is the hotels way of getting money back off me, for someone elses actions. Just be aware of this scam. I felt offended and angry when I left the hotel, not thinking about our friends wedding, which should have been the case.","title":"\u201cAppalled and disgusted\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":3,"Reviews":2,"service":1,"value":1,"Location":"Herts","cleanliness":2,"Helpful":5,"date":"13 November 2010","sleepQ":0,"rooms":4}
{"User":"tabithaEngland","Cities":24,"text":"We have just had a lovely weekend at Ansty Hall whilst visiting relatives in the area. The village location ,beautiful grounds and a grand old building make for a relaxing away from it all escape. Our \"executive\" room was in the main house ( but some rooms are in the grounds and this means that you have to go outside to get to them). It was well appointed with high ceilings and thick blackout curtains at the windows. However the bed was probably the least comfortable that I have ever experienced in a hotel. It was very soft and we could feel the springs through the mattress topper. We also had a problem in that there was a speaker below our room (room 26) situated in the dining room and music was playing up through the floor at a very early hour of the morning. Neither of us slept well. The breakfast was fantastic (even veg sausages for us veggies) .It was freshly cooked to order and came out piping hot and beautifully presented . As one previous guest has noted, though, the piped piano music in the dining room is on such a short loop that you wonder if it's a deliberate ploy to get guests through the restaurant more quickly as they can't bear to hear the same piece of music repeated more than a few times (and how do the staff put up with it?). We didn't eat at the hotel in the evening but the Rose And Castle pub in the village deserves a mention. It is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel and is very atmospheric. The food was outstanding and the service very good, but book in advance as it gets busy. The staff at the hotel were always friendly and willing to help, although they could be a little too informal at times.one member of staff at breakfast told my husband that he was \"weird\" for wanting Tabasco sauce on his eggs .

The hotel is very traditional and could do with a bit more internal signage so that you know where to go without having to ask for assistance from the staff on a regular basis. However, the staff are very friendly, chatty and helpful. The room I had was in the main building overlooking the garden which was very nice, good sized room and well appointed bathroom. Went down for dinner in the evening, it was very quiet in the restaurant, only about seven diners, but the food was very good, although as you would expect, it was a little on the pricey side, but no matter as it was an excellent meal. Breakfast in the morning was a livelier affair with a great choice at the buffet and fantastic portion for the traditional full English. I guess it possibly isn\u2019t a issue for those with dining companions, but at breakfast there was a constant audio loop of Grieg\u2019s Morning that just got played over and over and over again for the 45 minutes I was in the room.

On our first evening there we ventured down into Ansty and had a nice meal and a few drinks in the local pub its only a 5 to 10 min walk away and well worth a visit. Breakfast at the hotel is buffet style for juices cereals etc then a great tasting cooked breakfast is brought to the table. The Ladies that serve the breakfast were very good at their job remembering our names each morning and generally being friendly they made us feel very welcome. The first day we went to Warwick Castle and had a great day out. Later that evening we enjoyed a very nice meal in the restaurant and were expertly looked after by the head waiter. Unbeknown to me he was aware it was my birthday and I was given a cake including candle. Was a nice touch but was done tastefully. Nothing was too much trouble even when we asked if we could take our coffee in the lounge. All in all a great hotel where the staff seem to be excellent at their jobs and their main aim is to insure that their guests are well looked after.

Breakfast was ok but the scrambled eggs were sloppy and tasteless. Resembled what I would imagine powdered eggs to look and taste like. But the rest was very nice with lots of choice. However the most important part of any hotel is its staff , and they all seemed very competent and helpful. The master of ceremonies in charge of the wedding was fantastic, as was Mohammad on reception who was very helpful and professional.

We initially stayed in one of the new buildings next to the original building and the standard was very decent and importantly clean! It makes a very suitable place for business people to stay but be out of the city. It seems like a venue that holds lots of meetings and weddings and is set up accordingly. That said, we're don't usually use swimming pools and spa's so we didnt miss anything. I discovered on day 2 that we were not in an Executive Room as booked and we moved to the main building to try a suite for the last night. The reception discounted the rate automatically given the previous point. The suite is furnished to a high standard with a lovely big bed, modern furnishings and a clean, crisp bathroom.

The welcome at Reception was warm, friendly and efficient and each time we passed Reception we were spoken to. We were allocated a good sized room on the top floor of the 'Hall' which was well furnished and had a refurbished bathroom. Unfortunately when we looked closer in the bathroom we found about 20 dead or nearly dead flies with no indication where they had come from. I called Reception and in a short time a senior member of staff came to the room, armed with fly spray! A quick look and he left offering to find us another room. The whole problem was resolved in, about, 15 minutes and we were moved to another, even better, room. We had no other problems, neither were we affected by a wedding party who were located in the 'new' block. The restaurant service was efficient and the quality and quantity of food good. However neither the menu choice (which was fairly limited) nor the fish special changed each day and, if we had been staying more than a couple of days, it would have been difficult to choose something different. Also each menu item was individually priced so that to have a three course meal (coffee was extra) within the 'dinner allowance' of £25 limited the choice even further. Even the bread was an additional charge. All in all our experience was a good one and we would return to this hotel but we did feel that Macdonalds were trying to charge us for as much as possible and could have been more generous in their 'dinner allowance'.","title":"\u201cA good experience\u201d","hotelReviews":5,"location":4,"Reviews":5,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Luton","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":4,"date":"23 October 2009","sleepQ":0,"rooms":4}

{"User":"NeilHardwick","Cities":8,"text":"My wife and I stayed at Ansty Hall for a weekend break visiting Warwickshire's National Trust properties etc. We chose Ansty because we have had good experiences before with Macdonald managed hotels. The hotel is an imposing Georgian building set in beautiful grounds. However, the size of the car park and modern annex hints at it's main clientel which are large, boisterous wedding parties. Our initial room directly overlooked this main event and clearly would be obtrusive well into the night. A quiet word and an upgrade elsewhere was arranged. The food was good, but not of the standard we have experienced in other Macdonald hotels. Breakfast was OK but the hotel failed the 'freshly squeezed orange juice test'. 'It's all the cost cutting that's going on' one member of staff muttered to us. Overall the staff were excellent, especially the ex-pat Italian Head Waiter. And that just about sums up Ansty Hall. Good, but not exceptional.

Our meal the first night was lovely, the steak cooked just right for me. The second night I fancied something a bit different, which our waiter dealt with nicely, he asked the chef for me and I was cooked my favourite - lasagne. Fantastic customer service! One of the nicest things was when we came down for breakfast in the morning, the Receptionist remembered our name. All the staff make an effort to talk to you, and you are made to feel very welcome.

{"User":"mixip","Cities":33,"text":"Stayed here one night on business as a lastminute saving meant that stay cost only £4 more than the nearby Premier Travel inn. Good efficient and friendly reception - Stayed in stables block which was clean and room was very functional and comfortable. Wi-fi at the hotel is T-mobile only which is handy (but I guess only if you're already a T-mobile Hot-zone customer!). My colleagues who have previously stayed in the main house say that the stables are much better (less chintzy) My only concern would be in the summer; there's no air-con in the rooms (that I could see) so unless there is central air I can imagine them being quite hot. As my room was ground floor my window only opened slightly, but annoying didn't remain open so had to be wedged - it did rattle a bit in the wind overnight too which woke me up a couple of times. The big wow factor for me was the shower - absolutely stunning - really strong pressure and a great size. Pub up the road is very good with huge food menu, but do book if you want to guarantee a table as it was busy (even on a quiet week night). All in a very nice hotel for the price I paid and definitely worth the money - but any more than £100 per night and I'd probably go for the Holiday inn 5 mins up the road.","title":"\u201cGreat - at the right price...\u201d","hotelReviews":50,"location":3,"Reviews":53,"service":4,"value":3,"Location":"London","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":43,"date":"18 April 2009","sleepQ":0,"rooms":4}

{"User":"climber1Cardiff","Cities":0,"text":"I read the previous reviews and was looking forward to a peaceful stay in a country hotel. I am generally a customer who is easily pleased so was expecting a lovely hotel . What we got was woken up at 11.15pm (change to British Summer time means that this was the equivilent to 12.15pm and had gone to bed hour early to allow for change) by a disco starting up in the function room metres from our bedroom with music so loud that it could not even be drowned out by putting the TV on and rattled the windows. We complained to the duty manager at 11.40pm who advised that he could move us to the \"quiet\" side of the hotel but that the disco would be stopping in 40mins. We understood that a move would mean getting dressed, packing our belongings and walking to the opposite side of the hotel. Not something anyone wants to contemplate when half asleep. We also understood that the music would be turned down as it was being played at ear drum damaging levels. The disco did not stop until 12.45am (or 1.45 with the hr change) and by this time my husband had got up, dressed and went to speak with the duty manager in person. Then came the removal of the disco equipment directly under our hotel window until 2.30am. Night Management were mocking and dismissive and thought that the offer to move us in the middle of the night was more than enough. We apparently should not have been placed in that room and apparently we should have been told about the function. We were not. Customer service was the worst ever encountered at any hotel in any country in the world. . My husband and I travel alot. Not what you would expect from a 4* hotel in the country. They simply could not have cared less. We both woke up exhaused and were consequently very late for the event we were attending. The matter remained unresolved the following morning - with no Manager in the hotel to deal with the complaint. A senior member of housekeeping tried to deal with matters but did not appear to have the authority to address all the issues. On the plus side the room was lovely and we were enjoying our experience until 11.15pm. The food in the resturant was very enjoyable and the resturant staff were friendly and welcoming. This hotel is serious let down by its senior staff. The hotel follows \"rules\" in a robotic fashion and no one seems to be able or willing to apply some genuine common sense to a situation. A mocking and unpleasent manager is also not quite what anyone would expect. Mistakes occur but the manner in which this hotel dealt with their mistake was appauling and the attitude of the night manager was quite unbelieveable. He seemed to enjoy the situation. We ended up leaving the hotel without settling the bill pending the General Manager dealing with the issue (the first time I have ever experienced such an incident). The matter has been settled now but with no direct contact with the General Manager. Communication and customer service is non existent. Be warned that the function room is very close to the hotel bedrooms and has no sound proofing at all. Functions clearly come before the comfort of hotel guests. Never again.","title":"\u201cIf you want to sleep - don't stay here\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Reviews":1,"service":1,"value":2,"Location":"Cardiff","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"30 March 2009","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}

I had looked at the other reviews on this site before making the booking and I agree that it is a fine hotel. I stayed there as I was attending the Heineken Rugby semi final in Coventry and I was flying out of Birmingham on Monday morning. The hotel has a great location not far from the motorway (you can hear some traffic noise but it was not a big issue). Getting to the Rioch for the game and Birmingham airport on Monday morning during rush hour were both easy trips. The hotel is a fine looking building and the gardens and grounds are kept to a high standard. Check in was efficient and friendly. We found all staff to be friendly and helpful and customer service and care is obviously very good. My wife does not like feather pillows and foam ones arrived promptly and without fuss. We paid a little extra to stay in the main hotel building. However, the seperate building is very close by and I am not sure if location is a real issue here. The room was well fitted out and in good condition as was every other part of the hotel I saw. Slipppers and a gown were the only things that were missing from our room that you might want. The fridge and mineral water (which was replaced each day) being particularly useful. The hotel was very busy on Saturday, in that there was a wedding on and the Saracens Rugby team were staying there in advance of the Rugby Match on Sunday. We ate in the restaurant on the Saturday night and the food was very good. Service was fine despite there being pressure on all hotel staff with the two parties. Breakfast was a mixtuire of buffet and table service for hot food and tea coffee. It was very good on both mornings. Ansty itself is a small village, we went for a nice walk by the canal and strollled the mile or so to the next one. We also visited the local pub for an afternoon drink and dinner on Sunday night. Unlike, other reviewers, we thought the standard of the food there awful. However, it was busy on Sunday night, nevertheless I would recommend eating in the hotel over it any day. The hotel was offering a deal whereby you got a second nights b&b free if you paid for one and ate a 3 course meal during your stay..

The hotel itself is rather grand looking from the outside, however the hall itself (downstairs only - reception, bar and library lounge) are looking a little tired and dated. Don't get me wrong, they are comfortable and clean but it would really lift the grandure of the hotel if a bit of money was spent. Nethertheless it still has a country feel about itself which is nice. The bedrooms (in the outbuildings) were likewise, decorated to early 90's standards; spacious, comfortable, but really lacked style. Didn't eat within the hotel, took some advice from a previous report and ate in the pub a short walk away. Food there was good and reasonably priced. Did have a few drinks within the hotel, staff were courteous, however drink prices were not cheap. I think a pint of Guinness was about £3.40. Summary: The hotel was fine for what we paid for it. We didnt stay in the hall itself so can't comment on the rooms there but our room was adequat but nothing to write home about. Had a problem with our shower (kept going cold!) which I reported on the customer comments card (couldn't be bother to complain at the time).

When we arrived I was amased at how easy it was to find and how beautiful teh property looked as we drove up teh sweeping drive. The check-in on Friday was very quick and simple. We were located in the new part of the building. The only downside being that there is no connecting building between the old manor house and the new part so we got very wet when it was raining. That said the room was wonderful. Large room with lovely bathroom. Everything was very clean and the bed was very comfy. On Saturday we drove to Warwick Castle (about 25 minutes away) and had a great day. We vacated the Castle grounds to get some lunch in the town centre. We found a lovely bar called The Keep - just across the road from the Castle. The service was great and the food was amasing. We will definatley visit here again probably to try the evening menu. We dined at the Ansty Hall on Satrurday night and I can't speak highly enough of the experince. The staff were very attentive and the dining room was lovely. The food was very good indeed. We were treated to home baked bread and enjoyed a lovely starter and main course (the lamb was cooked to perfection). The food was quite reasonable at £25 for two courses or £30 for three courses. There was an excellent wine selection to suit every budget. The only disappointment was being charged £4.75 for a bottle of Highland Spring (which I priced at the local supermarket the next day for 58p) - I felt ripped off.

{"User":"Dave_Cakes","Cities":20,"text":"I returned to Ansty Hall last week and was pleasantly suprised. The only thing that let the hotel down previously was the overstretched staff. This has now been rectified and the staff are far more composed and there for your every need. When I commented on the improvement, I was informed that there had been a change in management earlier in the year. It's amazing what a difference a few key people can have - previously one person covered front of house, the bar and any other requirements. There are now dedicated staff for each area and they are all very attentive, friendly and welcoming. Well done MacDonald Hotels!","title":"\u201cStaff overstretched? - not any more.\u201d","hotelReviews":21,"location":4,"Reviews":23,"service":5,"value":3,"Location":"England","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":49,"date":"21 July 2007","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}
{"User":"Margaret55","Cities":0,"text":"We have just returned from a wonderful weekend at this excellent hotel. There were four of us and we could not have asked for more comfortable rooms and excellent cuisine. The Chef is to be commended as are all the staff who were exceptionally helpful and friendly with a special mention to Receptionist Maria who made us feel very welcome and Charlotte whose delightful telephone manner won me over when I was deciding which hotel to go for. The service was first class and every whim catered for. The afternoon tea is to die for and if you do partake you had better make it a late dinner!! The restaurant was very inviting and relaxing and the food superb and again the staff were exceptional in their service and manner in fact we found it very hard to leave. Both my husband and I had dietary requirements and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was part buffet with everything you could ask for i.e. a good choice of fruit juices, cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, croissants, pastries, lovely little mini doughnuts, etc, etc, and a good choice of full english breakfast being cooked fresh to order and served piping hot. I would say this is one of the friendliest and most helpful hotels we have stayed in. It is a beautiful building set in lovely well tended gardens. Like most hotels it has a few little well worn spots but overall it was very cosy, comfortable and very clean. Well worth a trip and we shall be returning.","title":"\u201cA Wonderful Experience\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":1,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Essex","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":1,"date":"10 May 2007","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}

{"User":"delacourt","Cities":60,"text":"Whilst browsing on the internet I came across a dine and stay offer on the macdonald hotels web. The offer stated that if you dined in the Shilton restaurant on the set menu at £26.95 per person and had a bottle of house wine you could stay in an executive room for free. When I phoned the hotel I was told the offer was not available friday nights, so I pointed out that on the internet it states the offer is availble both fridays and sundays. The girl took my number so she could check, within 15 mins she had called and said that she had been thinking of another offer and yes I could stay on a friday night. When the girl was running through all the conditions of the offer it appeared that not only did you have to have dinner and wine but breakfast as well. I did mention that this was not actually stated on the web site - but was happy to take breakfast as even with wine it was going to be £100 cheaper than any other DBB rate I could find for the hotel. When we checked into the hotel the reception staff seemed pleasant enough, they were efficient with regards to checking us in and we received our key quickly. My husband and myself both found it a little strange that we were not given any information regarding restaurant opening times or locations especially as we were on the dine and stay offer. I was actually expecting to be asked if we wished to book a table in the restaurant as they knew we were going to eat in there. In the room there was an information book but under food and drink it told us how to book a conference or banquet, no information on the restaurants and opening times. Our room in the Stopford Wing was pleasant enough a typical Travel Lodge style and of a similar size, slightly better decorated, although the bathroom was of a higher standard, with a large separate shower cubical. The bar area was very busy as there was a wedding party in the hotel, but we didn't have any problems getting served and they were very efficient at collecting all the empty glasses, emptying ash trays e.t.c. On our way to the bar we tried to book a table in the restaurant for 8.00 and were told that a big Christmas party was book for 8.00 so we might have to wait for our food, we booked for 7.30. The food in the restaurant was very nice, service was OK but then again there were only three tables served that night, the Christmas party at 8.00 never appeared. The only thing I could pick up on was when serving the wine the waitress poured out half a glass for tasting, then proceeded to fill my husbands glass before mine - OK so now I'm being picky. Right breakfast - this unfortunately is where the hotel went down in my estimations and quite rapidly, even my husband was getting irritated. We went into the restaurant about 9.40 we were asked to sit at a shared table set up for 10 people. Fine if I was with a group of friends at the wedding or in a youth hostel, but not what I was expecting. So I asked if we could sit at a table for two as the were four empty but still with dirty crockery from previous guests, the waitress actually cleaned it straight up and re-set it for us without a grumble. The selection of food on offer was good there was a wide variety of cold continental and the hot menu looked good. We got hot drinks virtually straight away but then it took 20 mins before we actually managed to get someones attention to take our order for hot food. About 10 mins later we were asked if we would like toast, this never appeared. In the mean time people left right and center were complaining that they had ordered X,Y,Z and they were still waiting, food was being served but people had got fed up of waiting and left. Eventually the waitress appeared to inform us that our breakfast would be about two more minutes, but they were busy. Our food arrived, my husbands fry up was perfect no tomatoes as ordered, my haddock was fine hot and tasty, but the eggs were hard poached and stone cold, I put the plate on the side of the table, it was whisked away without so much as asking if it was OK. It was apparent that although there were three waiting staff they could not cope, there appeared to be a manager running round giving orders to clear tables e.t.c why didn't he get on and get his hands dirty! I really don't think the hotel staff had been informed about the offer that we were staying on as when I checked out the amount I was expecting to pay was the price that we were being charged for the room rate plus our dinner, wine and breakfast on top. The bill was sorted out quickly. I am so glad I was not paying the internet DBB rate of £220 or BB rate of £170 I would have been highly disappointed. I would say if you can get a room with £100 knock off these rates that would be a fair price.","title":"\u201cservice really let this hotel down\u201d","hotelReviews":91,"location":3,"Reviews":91,"service":1,"value":2,"Location":"Bidford-on-Avon","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":201,"date":"3 December 2006","sleepQ":0,"rooms":3}
{"User":"Dave_Cakes","Cities":20,"text":"The hotel has large, well appointed bedrooms and a good quality restaurant. The communal areas are outstanding and the perfect place to enjoy a drink, complementory nibbles, a roaring fire and a good book. The breakfast offers a wide selection from continental buffet to the full English. There is even the option of smoked haddock, which is well worth trying. For evening meals there is also a wide choice which varies daily. All of the meals were of a very high standard. The restaurant staff are very good, but the reception and bar are often unstaffed, so you have to wait around for service. However the staff are very helpful when they are there. It appeared to be more of an issue of management - one gets the impression of overstretched staff trying to fulfill a number of roles. The patio area for the bar is directly undereath some of the rooms and the bar is open till late, so you can have late-night revelllers keeping you awake in summer. To avoid this, ask for a room on the front of the house (or join the party!). I experienced a problem with the booking via the hotel's website. The booking link passes you, unknowingly, to a third party booking agent. The booking agent took a credit card number to hold the reservation and I settled the bill with the hotel on departure. I later discovered that the booking agent had also taken the full amount from my card, without my authority. The hotel denied any responsibility and left me to deal with the agent to retrieve my money. All in all the Ansty Hall is a good hotel, with great food, but suffers from being understaffed.","title":"\u201cBeautiful rooms, excellent food, staff overstretched\u201d","hotelReviews":21,"location":3,"Reviews":23,"service":2,"value":2,"Location":"England","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":49,"date":"6 November 2006","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}
{"User":"Stuartyboy","Cities":18,"text":"We have just returned from a one night stay at the Ansty Hall. Our friends were getting married and the reception was held here. We found the hotel very friendly and accommodating throughout our stay. I phoned the day before to request an earlier check in and this was granted with no questions asked. As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted with a friendly welcome with the staff interested in our journey (unfortunately a day delayed due to recent security alert!). We were in our room by 11am and it did not disappoint. Roomy with everything you'd ever want. I particularly enjoyed the massive shower. A lovely private venue for the wedding was the icing on the cake with beautiful grounds for photographs. The only downer is food and drink in the hotel are vastly overpriced. £5.20 for two juice drinks (non alco) and £4.90 for a vodka and coke. Hence noone was buying rounds and a few were sneaking off to their rooms to get laid into cheap booze they had brought with them! Also no leisure facilities so no chance of a swim. With all said the friendly staff and comfortable surroundings make this venue. I would stay here again at the right price!","title":"\u201cA Very Enjoyable Stay\u201d","hotelReviews":23,"location":5,"Reviews":24,"service":5,"value":3,"Location":"N.
