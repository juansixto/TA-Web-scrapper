Breakfast was served until 9am and I arrived at 2 minutes past nine. I was met at the TGI Friday door by a very abrupt and rude member of staff, who said that she could not serve me breakfast as it had gone 9am. I looked across the restaurant which was still busy with breakfast dinners and continental style food was still laid out. I asked again if I could go in and the answer was a short and abrupt \"No\"! I was not even offered the opportunity to just grab some toast, etc, which was readily available, as opposed to a full cooked breakfast. On returning to the hotel reception I spoke to the reception staff who advised that TGI's were always turning people away at breakfast and that they did not know what t o do about it! I pointed out that maybe it would have been helpful to tell customers on check in, that TGI's are strict about timings! I did get my money back for the breakfast and was directed to a Morrisons down they road who did an all day breakfast, actually for half the price of Premier Inn/TGI's. The end result was that Premier Inn/TGI Lost custom, I was inconvenienced. worth noting also that I had spent money in TGI the night before having dinner!

I went ahead and booked the all you can eat breakfast, it operates on timed slots which makes sense as it gets busy.

The one fly in the ointment was having to eat at TGI Fridays, next door, because the hotel doesn't have its own dining room and sends you there for breakfast. The staff were a little loud, but very helpfull. Unfortunately breakfast was dryed out one day, and swimming in water the next.

I would recommend going to the local supermarket for food of an evening though as the TGI Friday's is very expensive for what you get. However the supermarket is right next to the hotel and there is another cheaper but across the road.

{"User":"TheParkers52","Cities":0,"text":"Having used several Coventry hotels recently, this one has been the first that has inspired me to write a review. The bedrooms appear to have been recently modernised and on each of my stays here, have been cleaned to an exceptionally high standard. Although this is not the prettiest hotel I have stayed in , the location more than makes up for its lack of kerb appeal. It gives easy access to all areas of Coventry and as it is not a city centre hotel has ample free parking. All of the staff i came across seemed happy to help. This particular Premier Inn is adjacent to a TGI Friday`s restaurant which was enjoyable but the reception staff were also happy to recommend other local places to eat. I also liked The Cocked Hat pub across the road for evening meals. There is also a Morrisons supermarket within walking distance if you need any provisions.

The place had the look and feel of an airport hotel (which is what it is really as it's very near the airport), with very narrow corridors making it feel a little claustrophobic. The main downside to me was the attached TGI's. Don't get me wrong I'm not complaining about the food but for someone to stay here on business, I really can't be bothered with all of the hustle and bustle of TGI's when I go in there on a night.

We then struggled to take luggage up the stairs but the room seemed clean enough. The shower had a disappointing trickle which was completely inadequate and then into bed... The bed was firm except for the groove in the middle from hard use and we both clung onto the sides all night to avoid elbows in ears etc etc I wouldn't have said anything in complaint as it wasn't worth conflict for the sake of a single night but, unfortunately the manager asked if everything was OK and was told. Sure, they gave us a refund but, this hotel makes 3rd place on Tripadvisor's list of hotels in Coventry!!! We have tried some of the others and found them shockers by world standards. We had just had a very pleasant three nights at the Sheraton Skyline in Heathrow so we're not serial complainants but can only think that people with very low expectations would think Premier Inn was OK unless the only criterion is cleanliness as this place scored highly on this!

No air con in rooms (it was not mentioned on the web site) and it was very hot and difficult to sleep in. They had fans, but the rooms were hot and sticky anyway. Also, no telephone in the room, so if one does not have a mobile phone and there is an emergency, no way to call for help. Staff were very friendly, the rooms were clean. The room lighting was too low, a bit dingy for my taste. For dining there was only the TGI Friday (inferior breakfast) on the premises; my elderly father did not feel comfortable eating dinner in a party atmosphere; unfortunately, there was no other dining option on the premises for him. This may be good fun for others but not for us, a family spanning three generations.

Extremely clean, beautiful large bed, welcome tea and coffee on the table (plus ample in reception if you wanted more!), a HUGE TV set on the wall - not some cheap tat hanging on a bracket by threadbare screws as in most hotels! Great choice of channels on the freeview selection. As I said, we had booked well ahead and got the room for a really good price - well worth it! We had previously stayed at the Premier Inn at Sparrow Hall, Coventry and were equally perfectly happy! I can't comment on the breakfast at TGI Fridays as we didn't want breakfast. (My wife and I are not big eaters), so my blank response in no way reflects any opinion. Would we stay again? ABSOLUTELY! No need to look elsewhere! We love Premier Inns!","title":"\u201cSuperb as usual!\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":5,"Reviews":0,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Coventry","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"25 May 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}
{"User":"WorldTraveller580","Cities":0,"text":"First stay in a Premier Inn. Receptionist made her welcome sound geniune, which can't be easy. She was very helpful and avoided that jaded sing-song response one encounters so often - well done, I really appreciated that. Building was clean and well kept, the room also. Everything appeared new. Room very quiet at night - slept like a log - all equipment worked, and no complaints about the shower. My only gripe was TGI Friday - it was heaving all evening (which was good for them) but there is no way I am going to eat dinner being deafened by dance anthems. Probably an age thing, to be fair - I was the oldest one there - but a short trip to a decent restaurant is definitely called for. The TGIF take-away option I settled for was truly awful and was a mistake that will not be repeated. In total: Hotel good and I will recommend it for colleagues in future - good value, but TGIF bad.","title":"\u201cGood choice for a hotel.\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Reviews":0,"service":4,"value":5,"Location":"Brighton","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"15 May 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":4}
{"User":"hellen73","Cities":0,"text":"Having never stayed in a premier inn before I was a little wary, as being used to 5* hotels!!! We were attending a wedding in Coombe Abbey & this was only 5 miIes away.Having read mixed reviews about premier inI was a little wary.The guy on check in was very friendly & polite.We had 2 rooms next to each other, the rooms were small but were clean.There is also pub on the site that can be reached by an enclosed corridoor. We ate dinner there, standard pub food, it was ok not the best by my children thought it was ok so they were happy Breakfast next day was ok, great value as kids ate free & they loved it, cereals, toast cooked breakfast, yoghurt &fruit This is a budget hotel & for what we paid for 5 of us it was a bargain .This premmier inn is certainly worth a visit if your on a budget. If like us you are attending Coombe Abbey this is ideal as its 2 minutes away Room Tip: Rooms furthest away from reception, get less noise as everyone has to pass through the corridoors &a...

{"User":"ali_m199","Cities":0,"text":"I've stayed here several times over the last 5-years and have always found this Premier Inn to be nice and clean with lots of parking spaces. it's also conveniently located. sadly it would seem that in an effort to save money, the moguls at Premier Inn have reduced the amount of water that comes out of the shower (it's something I've noticed at other Premier Inns) and it's very poor. it's also the case that the standards at TGI Friday's (next door) have yet to improve. when i arrived at 8pm i was told i would have to wait an hour for a table - this despite the fact that were plenty of empty tables available - i decided to eat elsewhere. unfortunately i didn't have this option the next morning, having already paid to have breakfast included. the TGI staff were helpful and polite, however the plates, cutlery, cups etc, were either stained or not properly cleaned - and i mean all of them. the food was also mediocre, and despite asking for a poached egg, i was given a fried egg. if this were an isolated incident then i wouldn't bother to complain, however on my previous visits to this TGIF, there has always been something to complain about, be it the service, bland food, or getting the order mixed up so by all means stay here, just try to avoid having to eat at TGIF","title":"\u201cnice hotel, let down by mediocre shower and dreadful TGI Friday's\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Reviews":0,"service":0,"value":3,"Location":"Glasgow, United Kingdom","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":0,"date":"4 May 2012","sleepQ":4,"rooms":4}
