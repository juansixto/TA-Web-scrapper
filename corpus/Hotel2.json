Best of all were the friendly and helpful staff. There is no parking at the Premier inn but there is a public car park very near.

Check in very smooth, hotel room amazing, bed very comfortable, shower and bath were amazing, location is very good my room over looked the Metrolink station, luckily it was on Boxing Day therefore didn't have early trams ( this would have likely been an issue with noise). Went down for breakfast the next day but didn't choose to eat simply because I felt slightly intimidated by the fact staff were just stood there chatting away.. Strange I know! Would reccomend to anyone.","title":"\u201cGreat stay\u201d","location":5,"service":3,"value":5,"cleanliness":5,"date":"30 December 2012","sleepQ":0,"rooms":5}{"text":"Fantastic hotel thee best premier inn I have stayed in!

Further, I went to book for another night stay online which to my surprise, the rate is reasonably cheap. Which lead to my scepticism about the quality of room that my family going to have. To my surprise, not only so near to Metro station, which is so convenience for a tourist like us (although it is a bit outskirts from Manchester Picadilly - about 30 mins with Metro), the hotel especially the room was so comfortable. A family of 4, we had 2 single bed and 1 queen size bed in a reasonable size room. Bathroom was clean too, that is more important. Staff were friendly. Breakfast spread was reasonable, but not much option for us Muslim. But still, we had our stomach full before we leave the restaurant. Overall enjoyed the stay","title":"\u201cGreat stay\u201d","location":3,"service":5,"value":5,"cleanliness":5,"date":"24 December 2012","
