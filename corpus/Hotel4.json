After realising that the hotel doesn't have it's own car park and you have to use the Belgrade Plaza one instead then things became much clearer! The parking is subsidised by premier inn to £5 If you check out before 9, otherwise it's just under £8 a night. The hotel rooms were the usual premier inn standard including the usual dim / energy saving lighting! Clheckin/out was really friendly. The reception was staffed by the same person that ran the bar during the evening so that made getting another towel a bit of a wait but otherwise ok.

The hotel is in a great location just off the Coventry ring road and the edge of the city centre. The hotel has a large multi-story car park next door, as are a Pizza Express/Bella Italia and Cafe Rouge. The hotel was full for the long weekend we were there but, this was never a problen. Check in and check out were completed quickly and without issue. Breakfasts got busy but never overwhelming. If you pay for the Premier Breakfast you have all-you-can eat hot and cold food. The hot food must be ordered from the waiting staff and is brought to your table. After feedback hash browns are back on the menu, they taste great too!

We had a double room which was large and a typical Premier Inn room. It was very comfy, spotless and we heard no noise at all. Very peaceful sleep in a very comfy bed. We did have a few drinks in the bar in the afternoon and we had an evening meal. We have never eaten in a Premier Inn before, but we will in future. The food was very nice and a good price.

Each room (across the corridor from each other) had a good quality double and two lesser quality single beds. Rooms and double beds were generously proportioned. They had the standard amenities, including hairdryer, tea/coffee, TV. No safe though. You can get 30 minutes wi-fi for free by registering with Premier Inns online, after that payment is required. The rooms were comfortable and we slept well (maybe it was the psychology of the sleep guarantee!). Breakfast was free for kids with paying adults, which was good value. There was a choice of cooked breakfast or \"continental\", with a large selection of self-service cereals, breads/pastries/muffins, fruit, yoghurt, juices, and bottomless tea and coffee of several varieties. Staff were friendly and service-orientated, from reception, to cleaners to wait-staff. Location was handy to the centre of Coventry, including the bus and train stations. Only downside is that there is no parking at the hotel, rather residents have to use the Belgrade Square multi-storey carpark across the way. It is well-signposted and we had no trouble finding it coming from Birmingham airport direction. Residents of the hotel get a 10% discount. Daily rates are around \u20ac7. Check-out was quick - essentially we just had to hand in the keycards and get the parking discount ticket.

{"User":"Scotlandscout","Cities":0,"text":"Booked the hotel as we were going to the Cheltenham Festival and decided not to pay the hugely inflated hotel rates in Cheltenham and as we have lost our regular hotel. We needed to be near the bus station (7 mins walk from the hotel) as we were catching a coach from there to Cheltenham and the hotel is ideally placed. Glad though did not book the Britannia...by that looked grim from the outside.. Anyway the Premier Inn was quite busy when we arrived late after parking the car just over the way from the hotel which is very handy. Reception staff very friendly and chatty with a warm welcome and quick check in. Small cosy bar/food area which was busy when we arrived and did always appear to have people using it, did not have breakfast though Our first room was not suitable as it was right in front of the main door after the lifts and the door bangs when closed, not a good room to be in when people coming and going and not everyone would close it quietly. Back down to ask to change the room, changed without problem or fuss but obviously staff are aware of the problem with the door, so we had another large room away from the lifts. This room had a double bed with 2 singles. You know what you\u2019re getting with a Premier Inn and this one was no exception, clean, tidy with all you need for a short stay. Plenty of hanging space and tea/coffee kettle, hairdryer but quite a small TV though. Bed fine although a little hard for me, but bedding good (although the maid did forget to make the bed one day, I must have done a good enough job myself!) Plenty of large thick towels towels in the bathroom which again was very clean and tidy with an one soap fits all dispensers on the wall, good shower pressure as well. The car park was charged at £7.50 a day through the hotel, but you\u2019re better off with the £20 offer the car park has if you\u2019re staying more than 2 nights which you can pay over the counter at the car park itself. There are places around the Inn to get something to eat and we did end up having a curry from round the corner just past the theatre which was quite good All in all good base at an excellent price for what you get and I would recommend this Premier Inn if your needing to stay in the area.","title":"\u201cExcellent base for what we needed\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Reviews":0,"service":4,"value":5,"Location":"England","cleanliness":4,"Helpful":0,"date":"16 March 2013","sleepQ":4,"rooms":4}

Well it was when the swipe card to my room wasn't working, and I was trying to get reception to correct it. The whole thing is very safe and secure, to get anywhere within the hotel, you have to swipe. Parking is paid for at this one (it's close to the city). Room was typical Premier Inn (from my limited experience). It was winter, and the room was cold, when I bumped up the heating, it was warmer, but the fan was dead noisy. Not something that usually bothers me, but this time it did. 30 mins free wifi each day, but a who day is only 3 pounds, and it works fine and easily. There is a bar/restaurant attached, we had breakfast there both times. First day was a lot better than the second, I'm assuming it was because they were short staffed, it took some time, one person on my table's was forgotten. Had to nag for a coffee mug, etc. Besides the breakfast, and the check-in issue, the staff were friendly and helpful. Just outside there is a pizza restaurant, didn't eat there.

{"User":"iamtripper","Cities":0,"text":"I was attending a birthday party in Coventry and needed somewhere cheap to stay overnight, I managed to get a sale deal......£19 for a double room for one night, bargain ! For a \"budget\" hotel chain it was really good, I'd say better than Travelodge which I've stayed in before. The room was spacious, clean and modern, usual tea / coffee and there were soap / shower gel dispensers in the bathroom so you don't necessarily have to take your own. Premier Inn have a good nights sleep guarantee as well, any problems there's someone available to help 24/7 such as if you want to change pillows for a different firmness ! The reception, bar and dining areas were all clean and modern looking. Janine the receptionist was great at check-in, friendly, polite, efficient and she was very informative such as the good nights guarantee, if we wanted to book a table for evening meal, if we needed a taxi etc. We decided to eat at the hotel for ease before going to the party, there are some meal deals, we went for the 3 course meal deal....decent choices for each course, also a drink and breakfast next day were included, all for £22 or £23 (can't remember which !). I had chicken goujons, steak & chips and cheesecake. It was all good. Breakfast the next day was help yourself to cereals, toast, crumpets, muffins, yogurt, juices, tea / coffee, when you were ready the waiting staff then took your order for cooked breakfast, although you ordered rather than help yourself you could order as much as you wanted. I had a 2 egg omelette, two sausage, one veggie sausage, fair bit of bacon, beans - all tasted great, good quality food. The meal deal saved something like £11 per person compared to if we had ordered each item that we had so for two of us this was a good deal. The waiting staff (Sam in particular) were also polite, friendly and interested in making your stay as good as possible. All the staff we met were young people but I've got to say that they were all friendly & polite and seemed to really care about the service they were delivering. So all in all it was a great stop over and I'll definitely look to stay at a Premier Inn again.","title":"\u201cGreat place for a stop over !\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":3,"Reviews":0,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Droitwich, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"3 February 2013","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

The bed was a double, nice and firm. Here are a few niggles, none of which should put you off staying here. The lighting in the room has a peculiar \"cold\" quality due to the preponderance of halogen and EU inspired light bulbs. The bath had no grab handles making stepping into and out of the shower a hazardous business for older guests. The TV is quite small and the sound quality is not the best.

{"User":"Lee A","Cities":0,"text":"My son and I recently visited Coventry to see the T Rex musical \"20th century Boy\" at the Begrade Theatre, virtually next door to the hotel. Initially, it seemed difficult getting to the hotel by car for I could see the hotel in the distance, but because the city centre is pedestrianised could not drive directly to it. However, driving back onto the ring which circles the city, it proved easy to get to and was well signposted. I have to say, the hotel stands in an excellent location, convenient and central to the brilliant Belgrade Theatre and amongst a bustling hive of shops, restaurants and bars that are flourishing throughout the city centre. Next door to the hotel is also a multi storey car park where, on production of a ticket from the hotel, a discount can be obtained for overnight parking. The hotel itself should pride itself on its cleanliness and attention to detail, for it sparkled throughout. Our room was spacious, well equipped and spotless! The two beds, a double and single, were of the best quality. Firm but not hard mattresses which guaranteed us a good night's sleep. Bedding was of excellent quality, clean and crisp - a sheer delight to get into. There were even two extra pillows provided, offering a softer \"feel\" for those who favour a less rigid support under their head. I thought that this was a great personal touch! I loved the bathroom which was spotlessly clean. The taps, basin, bath and shower sparkled impeccably. The shower was super efficient - I couldn't find fault with anything. Although the room was spacious, within seconds of switching on the controlled heating it was warm and cosy, even though it was cold, miserable and wet outside! I also found the hotel to be very quiet inside despite its central location. We'd booked breakfast for the following morning - and this is the only element of the hotel's service which sadly let them down - prompting me to rate it 4 rather than the 5 it really should be credited with. We got to the restaurant at 8am and had to wait by the door, behind others, for 15 minutes until a table became available. Once shown to our table we were asked to help ourselves to coffee, coissants, toast, fruits, cereals etc and that a waiter would soon take our orders for cooked breakfasts. However we waited for over 40 minutes to have our orders taken. I had ordered a full English breakfast which was eventually served without bacon. The waiter appologised and quickly brought out some bacon which was freshly cooked. Our breakfasts were cooked to perfection and maybe well worth the wait - or perhaps it was because we were so hungry! Anyhow, I felt that the amount of time we'd waited to be served was far too long. Yes, as the restaurant staff pointed out, they had been rushed off their feet, which I can fully understand. However, I just formed the opinion that the restaurant was too small to cater for the amount diners wanting breakfast that morning. Certainly, if this is the norm - others will complain. But overall a great hotel to stay in providing exceptionally good value for money. It certainly brightened up a miserable, cold, wet weekend. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to all my friends. Definitely one of the better hotels I have stayed in.

I stayed here three nights for a conference and can hardly fault it. The staff were all lovely and the food was pretty decent and good value (I wouldn't say amazing though). My room was a really good size - I couldn't believe the price I got it for, it was clean and comfortable, the bathroom was like new and the bath even had a plug. (tip: bring bubble bath!) I'd have liked better lighting in the bathroom so it was more relaxing (also wish they'd plumbed it the other way round so I could lie back in the bath and see the TV!) but that's a minor point. I slept really well at night, no noise problems - you'll occasionally hear people walking by the door, or a loud motorbike passing by outside, but I found the room to be very well sound insulated, and I'm quite fussy about that kind of thing. Wifi was decently priced, £3 per 24 hours with first half hour free each day. Unfortunately the only time I wanted to buy a voucher, the wifi was down. It's a shame you have to go down to the desk to buy wifi vouchers, would be nice to do that through the portal. If I return to the conference next year, I'll definitely book here again.","title":"\u201cDid not expect that.\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":4,"Reviews":0,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"UK","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"2 October 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5}

{"User":"janetj589","Cities":0,"text":"We always try to choose a PI close to the railway station and all amenities and this PI fits the bill. Is appx a steady 15min walk from the station through lovely city centre gardens. But if you have lots of luggage or its raining, numerous buses stop at Belgrade Plaza and PI is just behind there. It is also within easy walking distance of the Transport Museum, Cathedral, Belgrade Theatre (this is virtually next door)and all city centre shops and eating/drinking places. Our room met the standards we expect from PI, all the basic facilities, spotless,comfortable, roomy. We were in room 503 which faced private flats and the Belgrade multi~storey car~park (not half as bad as it sounds!), and below us (5th floor) was an unloading area,and though we went through the week it was very quiet day and night. However because of this Im guessing that even numbered rooms face the ringway road? This must be fairly noisy as traffic is constant, in our room with the window open this was just a low drone, but I cant imagine opening the window at the front?This could also be a problem as this PI lacks air~conditioning and we would have been v.uncomfortable with the window closed. To be fair staff seem aware of this and there is a note in the room saying that fans are available. Staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.They provided a city map to show where tourist sights were, and all their directions and information was accurate. we have never faced indifference from PI staff but here they just seemed happy to go that extra mile to help out. We didnt eat here as we wanted to get out and about for awhile in the evenings so I cant comment on the food and as we didnt drive there Im not 100% sure but believe that car~parking is at the adjacent Belgrade multi~storery and is a reduced fee (£5?) per 24hrs for PI customers. We made an on~line advance booking and paid £58 for the two nights which we think excellent value.There may be more up~market hotels in Coventry but they would be hard pushed to give better value at that price.

{"User":"saf51","Cities":0,"text":"Stayed one night for a family wedding.

The room was large, comfortable and clean. Very good breakfast - staff very friendly. We parked our car in the multi storey public car park next door and I was a little concerned, but worries were unfounded as car in same place and condition we left it in. ( there are banners up around the car park stating that is an \"award winning car park\" how do you get an award for being a car park-the mind boggles-perhaps it's extra safe?) If you stay in the PI, there is a saving on the car park charge. When checking out the receptionist signs the parking docket and you take it to the customer service desk next to the car park paying machines (don't put the ticket in the machine). We paid £7.50 for just under 24 hours-the manned desk accepts cash or credit/debit card- I asked the guy what was easier for him and he said card payment so that's what I used.

Our room on the 6th floor was great, good sized room, clean, modern, with everything in good working order (except the internet...which we had some problems accessing). It is a bit of a walk from the rail station, but we did it both ways with our bags, and it isn't a problem if you know where you are going. Access to all the sights in Coventry was good too, all walking distance. We were happy to be checked in early, and to get a room on a high floor. It was quiet, air conditioned, with opening windows, which we also like. So we would definitely recommend the PI at Coventry (and Coventry too...it is a lovely city with lots to see) Room Tip: Rooms are quiet due to the good insulation, but high floors are good, as are rooms away from the lif...

BIG DEAL SO WHAT ! I was told an overnight charge would be about £5.00 with the Premier Inn stamping and validating the car parking ticket, NOT SO !

{"User":"Oldbrookie","Cities":0,"text":"We booked this Premier Inn for an annual sporting event in Coventry, on the recommendation of others who've stayed there in previous years. No dedicated parking but the Belgrade Plaza multi storey is literally next to the hotel which is easy to find from the ring road. We arrived around 11.30am and even though check-in time wasn't until 2pm, the receptionist let all of us (we were part of a group of 10) leave our luggage in a secure holding area. We returned later in the afternoon and checked in which was smooth, friendly and efficient - no quibbles whatsoever when we asked for two key cards for our room. We had a room on the 4th floor and despite it directly overlooking the main road, we couldn't hear any traffic noise at all. We ordered a sandwich in the bar before heading out early evening, which was excellent value for the money and practically a main meal in itself! Group of us returned at around 11.30 to gather in the hotel bar - told that although they had stopped serving food, we were more than welcome to order in a pizza, we were even given the phone number to order it from! Room was very comfortable indeed, lovely comfy bed more than big enough for two - only negative would be that the pillows were all far too soft and it was difficult to get comfortable with them, but that really is a very small negative in amongst far more positives! Small, fast quiet kettle for tea and coffee, new, flatscreen TV with Freeview, plenty of space for two people to stay in relative comfort. No noise whatsoever from adjoining rooms or from the corridors Checkout the following morning was again fast, friendly and efficient and the receptionist reminded us to take our car park ticket to them when we eventually left the multi storey so they could validate it which would give us 10% off the total. Hotel is in a great location, just off the ring road, right next to the multi storey as well as Pizza Express, Bella Italia and the Belgrade Theatre (but we didn't hear any associated noise from any of those), and literally only five minutes from the centre of Coventry.

Parking is discounted by the hotel but there was plenty of space. Enough of any negatives. The reception gave us a lot of help on the phone to find the parking and when we arrived checked us in promptly and offered good advice on alternative places to eat that were still open on a Sunday evening. The room was amongst the best Premier Inn rooms I've stayed in, which makes it a really comfortable. Premier have \"upped their game\" considerably in recent years (I use them about once a month). We wandered into the city for a couple of hours (which was quiet being a Sunday) but there was still a choice of places to eat. It's difficult to find an independant, or one of the affordable up market, Hotels who offer better than Premier Inn.. I had to leave too early to catch breakfast but the bar/restaurent area looked really nice. All in all a very nice stop over. Again it confirms that they are no longer competig with Travel Lodge..

The staff were friendly and helpful from the moment we got there (we arrived early and asked to leave our cases, but were allocated a room straight away) to the moment we left.

{"User":"AshBush","Cities":0,"text":"I stayed alone in the City Centre Coventry Premier in on a business trip recently. The location is a bit confusing as it sits on a large ring road and the entrance is effectively at the back of the building (you could be forgiven for thinking you were going down a dead end). The reception is a bit tired and the bar was small (large TV showing football) but you could have a table in the restaurant (semi-partitioned from the bar). The food was standard pub fare. There is a Pizza Express next door, which I would probably have used if not alone. Door security from the reception to the lifts is card key which was good, and then again from the lift lobby to the corridor where rooms are located. It makes you wonder if there is a local problem that makes this necessary.

When I was told it was at the other end of the city centre, I wasn't happy. It was a 30 minute walk with heavy bags in 30 degree late September temperatures. In the morning, I needed to be off early for a meeting, so I got to breakfast for 6.30 and put in my order (I had to chase the waitress - she wasn't that interested in taking orders). I needed to be finishing for 6.50 to get my train. When it got to 6.45 and I still didn't have my breakfast, I politely asked the waitress where my food might be. She then told me, \"Oh, yeah.

{"User":"coolgeri","Cities":0,"text":"My husband, daughter and I stayed at this hotel for one night, having taken our son up to Coventry University. The hotel is ideally situated in the City centre, within walking distance to the cathedral, shopping centres and the University. We had booked a family room. This turned out to be a very clean, nicely furnished room. The beds were extremely comfortable and we all had a good night's sleep. We noticed that the hotel has a policy, that if anyone doesn't have a comfortable night's sleep they don't have to pay. This is a very pleasant touch, although it would be difficult not to sleep well due to the fault of the hotel. In the evening we sat in the bar, and the young lady serving behind the bar made us feel very welcome indeed. I don't know her name but she said she had been a student at Manchester University, and was very helpful and knowledgeable. The bar and the restaurant are one room, a very pleasant and relaxing environment. The breakfast was to die for! We had paid for the full English breakfast, which was beautifully cooked and delicious. The buffet style Continental breakfast was outstanding too; you could eat as much as you want, and there was so much choice, from croissants, muffins and toast to various cereals, a bowl of fruit salad, fruit compote, several types of yoghurt and several conserves. There was also a choice of tea, coffee and fruit juices. The hotel was very full the night we stayed, I suspect a lot of University parents, like ourselves, were staying there. The staff coped amazingly considering the number of people they had to cater for at breakfast, and they were friendly and courteous throughout. We can't speak highly enough of the staff, and the hotel was excellent value for money. In short, our stay at the Premier Inn was perfect, and we fully intend staying there on our next visit to Coventry.

Great location for where I need to be and exactly the low budget hotel I need for a one night stay. Staff were welcoming and the check in process very easy. Room are typical good modern Premier Inn standard and very clean. Downside is certainly the cost of the carpark which is a multi storey carpark. You can get you ticket swipped for discount but it was still around £5.00 for an overnight park.

We were visiting to watch a Football match at the nearby Ricoh Arena. and for myself to take part in the Fun Run, the next day at the Nearby War Memorial Park, I telephoned on the friday to double check Car Parking and ask if we could arrive early, as we didn't want to have to park at the Ricoh Arena,and spoke to Leanne, who was very polite and friendly and explained we could at worse leave our bag behind Reception if our room wasnt ready, arrived just before 1.30pm and the receptionist checked us in and Even telephoned for a taxi for us so we didnt have to walk to find one. We have stayed at at about a dozen Premier inn's before and this is by far the best. ALL the staff were friendly from the first to last one we had any dealings with from telephoning on the friday, check inn, dinner in the evening, breakfast around the hotel and check out. Our room was on the second floor, looked out onto the Belgrade theatre and we could hear a pin drop, the best nights sleep i have had. parking is in a multi storey a stones throw away and is very secure so dont worry £8.10 for the 20 or so hours there. the resturant in the evening has a very good menu from something small to even if you want a starter, main and desert. brilliant well worth the money we paid, As a family were not often all in the same place at the same time, so thank you Premier Inn Coventry City Centre for making our family weekend be the best one we have had for a long while, WE WILL BE BACK............AND SOON,","title":"\u201cBEST PREMIER INN WE'VE STAYED AT\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":0,"Reviews":0,"service":5,"value":5,"Location":"Tamworth, United Kingdom","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"21 August 2011","sleepQ":5,"rooms":0}
{"User":"DEAN553","Cities":0,"text":"Stayed with family, (2 kids). Room and staff were excellent and the breakfast was really good value, (kids eat free). So can't fault the actual hotel or staff. Car park is a multi storey next door which they say is £5 a day but actually if you park in the afternoon or early evening and don't move your car before about 8am, the cost carries over and it is closer to £8 even with the hotel discount. TIP: It is only £15 for a weeks parking ticket, so if you are staying a couple of nights it works out cheaper to pay the £15 weekly fee. This hotel is a good base for Warwick Castle, (15 mins drive away) and we also went into London by train - the train station is only just over a mile away or less than £5 in a taxi. It is also really close to Pizza Express and Bella Pasta.

{"User":"fremantlewa","Cities":0,"text":"As a tourist from Australia I was worried when family in England booked both Travelodge and Premier Inns for a short trip up north. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by the Premier Inn and wished in hindsight that we had only used them for the trip as not only Coventry but the other Premier we stayed at was of high quality. Its in a great location within Coventry with plenty of restaurants around it if you dont want to eat at the hotel. We chose to eat in and found the food to be very nice and fresh. Quiet rooms, very clean, comfortable beds .... Had breakfast and again - cooked fresh on request. Couldnt fault this hotel for the price we paid. Would definitely stay again! In fact it is because of this hotel that we chose another Premier Inn for a last minute booking later in the week. The only downside was that we had to park in the multi-story car park adjacent to the hotel and only 10% of the costs were reimbursed. And when checking out we had to lug our luggage (and there was quite a bit) over and up to the carpark as we couldnt work out how to get the car back to the entrance easily. Not a big deal I know but worth noting if you are booking in so its not a surprise !","title":"\u201cWell priced and a pleasant surprise\u201d","hotelReviews":0,"location":0,"Reviews":0,"service":5,"value":4,"Location":"Perth, Australia","cleanliness":5,"Helpful":0,"date":"15 August 2011","sleepQ":4,"rooms":0}
