The breakfast was good, as it usually is in Premier Inns, the only thing I'd say is that if you want the fresh porridge or the specially cooked eggs (if you don't want the standard scrambled), you need to order this as soon as you sit down as I ended up having finished my cooked breakfast before my egg arrived! I allowed for this on day 2 by requesting my egg as soon as I sat down. Guess it depends how busy they are.

The room itself was clean, tidy and modern although a little smaller than some Premier family rooms we have stayed in and the walls are quite thin (I could hearing snoring in a different room!). The problems we encountered with our stay were around the food and service in the Beefeater which was really very disappointing. The staff were very friendly but having had four of us all ordering steak (1 well done & 3 medium) to find 3 of them the most over cooked medium steak I have ever experienced really was shocking for a grill who base so much on their steaks! In fairness, we were given free drinks, as we did not have time to wait with the kids for 3 meals to be re-cooked but this did spoil what could have been a really pleasant meal. We received a voucher as we paid for the meal for buy one get one free on the breakfast so queried this with reception on returning to the hotel, as the last time we had stayed in a Premier Inn where this was being offered we were only charged for one breakfast as we checked in as they knew we were eating with them in the evening and then for breakfast. The receptionist said he wasn\u2019t sure so we should check in the morning \u2013 this we did but as a cash refund was needed and there was no cash we were told to ask at the restaurant and if they could not refund go back to reception. When we arrived for breakfast on the Sunday morning though it was little more than a shambles \u2013 2 big parties had arrived at the same time as us at 10am so the buffet ran out completely \u2013 we were then left with freshly cooked eggs and told the buffet would be restocked in 6-8 minutes. The eggs were sent back and replaced but again the buffet ran out almost as soon as it was replenished \u2013 40 or so minutes after entering the restaurant we finally managed to get the cooked breakfast we had paid for. I didn\u2019t complain as I could see the staff were trying hard and thinking that with the offer of a free breakfast it was not worth it. However, back at reception we were told the credit card would be refunded and someone would be in touch to do this \u2013 guess what no-one has been.

The big downside to this room was the noise - very noisy road and this room had no double glazing then we had a very creaky floor of the room above us where several baby elephants must have been staying - I know the constant walking across the room at 1am is not the hotel's fault, but the incredibly creaky floor is. We arrived at breakfast at 10am ish and was quite shocked at how messy the restaurant was. The waitresses were lovely but the food area was very messy - bean juice all over a stack of clean plates and muffin wrappers on the floor. Although you have to blame the ignorant guests that would make such a mess, the waitresses really should clean up as they went along rather than wait until the end of service - the place looked awful. Anyway, feeling very tired the next day, the receptionist asked if we'd had a good sleep! We all sighed a weary sigh and she refunded our stay without hesitation which was a very nice surprise. We probably would stay here again but only because it's so handy and would definitely take earplugs!","title":"\u201cHandy hotel, friendly staff but noisy\u201d","location":5,"service":4,"value":0,"cleanliness":4,"date":"18 February 2013","sleepQ":2,"rooms":5},{"text":"Excellent location only 15 minutes walk from old Trafford and 5 minutes from the Lowry and media city.

It is right on the Quays and affords you great views if you are on that side of the hotel, which I was. This time there was scaffolding up and some building work going on but it didn't impact on the size of the car park, the noise at night or in the morning. Check in was as effortless as always, the staff are welcoming without being boisterous - a good balance to strike in my humble opinion. The location is less than a £10er by taxi to my meeting location and I can park my car here during my meeting. The bed let them down this time but it was only my side and I didn't complain badly. I just commented. It kept making a clonking noise as I moved about during my sleep. The other side of the bed was not affected in the same way, so I knew it wasn't me. Apart from that everything else was great. The breakfast was enormous. I am now on a low fat regime due to medical reasons and I had eggs on toast, museli with yoghurt and coffee. I reckon I was stuffed and had only shoved in around 500-600 calories but more importantly under 10g of fat which is my max allowance for meals. The fact I have this strange dietary need was not even a problem because I could help myself to a very wide range of produce. We had some athletes behind us that commented on the healthy nature of the breakfast and some trade union members on the other side of us loving the slap up fried foods. Everybody seemed happy and replete and it represents great value for money. All in all a good stay, again. I will return.

The hotel is well placed, very clean and comfortable. Having a free open cvar park is for me a real benefit as comming from the Netherlands, I drive a left hand car and its a problem with ticket machines. We had a top floor room that was modern, clean and comfortable. The beds are quite high, but extremely comfortable and well placed for the large LED TV. Similarly the bathroom was spotless, however being a top floor, the shower, whilst adequate could not be described as a \"power shower\". Breakfast next door at the Beefeater was very good value, with the cooked part being prepared to order and truely \"limitless\". Staff were helpful and attentive. Much better than some local \"top\" brand hotels with buffet service at 2 x the price. The only \"fault\" I found was regarding the internet. Yes they offer free 30 mins per day, but only in the reception area which is not ideal, and if I was taking up the offer of £3 for 1 days internet, I would expect WiFi in my room . Note most people now use WiFi travelling, not cable.

We were given room 23 on the first floor which was ok , Its an old building that has old draughty windows , The room heater isnt much use and i would not like to stay there on a cold winters night as the heat control only controls a little wall mounted electric heater that cuts off when the heater reaches the desired temperature and not the room temperature which in my opinion is not good enough in this day and age. The room looked to have been recently painted and spruced up with a large flatscreen tv with a decent selection of free to air channels. There was tea and coffee facilities also. In the middle of the night my son and i were woken by the creaking floorboards of the room overhead ours and we had to listen to every step the person took around there room, The following morning i said this to gemma and she stated that all the floors were fixed in the refurbishment, I told her that obviously the ones overhead room 23 were overlooked and she insisted that they had been fixed which was not the case. You have to go to the building next door to and go up to the first floor beefeater restaraunt for breakfast which was ok but not as good as breakfasts we have had in other premier inns . They charge over £100 per night when there is an event in Old Trafford or on the quays and to be honest it is not worth that money to stay in an old building with drafty windows and poor heaters and creaky floors when for the same kind of money you can stay in a more modern hotel close by, We have stayed in the premier inn on waters reach next to Old Trafford on numerous occasions and will be staying there in future as it is a vastly superior hotel.

Still, this Premier Inn just might be the best I have stayed at. We had a very enjoyable stay for our end of year holiday from Dec 27th until Jan 1st. My wife, our 4 and 6 1/2 year old girls and myself shared a family room. We had a very warm welcome from receptionist Gemma and the room was nice and clean as one has come to expect from all Premier Inns and although smaller than a family room we got at a Nottingham Premier Inn exactly a year ago, it was also quieter, with really comfy double bed and nice proper beds for the little ones. I would have preferred sheets and blankets to duvets as the weather was quite mild and there was no way to get room temperature below 20ºC but the three girls were just fine. There was even a match going on on New Year's eve and more people turned up the night before (quite a few families) so it was busier but not really noisier (other guests were very nice as well). We had dinner nearly every night at the child friendly Beefeater pub next door (more on this below) and found food quality standards to be very good coupled to excellent value for money. We rented a car and drove around, it is quite easy to find one's way and everything is well signposted. The hotel car park had ample space for the estate we were given so no need to worry about returning the car with any extra dents or scratches! The Quays are an excellent location. The area has been renovated very nicely. It feels airy and invites to quiet, refreshing walks alongside the canals. The hotel is conveniently close to the Lowry outlet shopping centre which even if not too large we found to be full of interesting and keenly priced stuff we could not find in the otherwise lovely and vibrant city centre. There are quite a few other attractions at the Quays as well. You do need transport to get to the city centre but you can enjoy nice quiet walks alongside the canal and in five minutes you will be in the nearby Lowry shopping centre and other attractions at the Quays. All the staff at the hotel and pub made our stay a nice, relaxed and fulfilling one - unfortunately I cannot recall all their names but Sharon and Jim looked after us very well and Gemma and Sarah went to great lengths to help us with all sorts of information I cared to ask for, throwing in extra bits of invaluable advice. The Beefeater pub staff serving the tables and the bar were great: Mike and Zerina were nice and helpful, and in particular lovely Roisin looked after us all so well that she made the little girls (and most certainly us grown-ups) feel right at home! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to go to Manchester on holiday as apart from being so well located for peace and quiet and in such a convenient location, the staff deserve a big thank you - they go the extra mile and really set it apart.","title":"\u201cA very enjoyable stay\u201d","location":5,"service":5,"value":5,"cleanliness":5,"date":"10 January 2012","sleepQ":5,"rooms":4},{"text":"Had stayed at Salford Quays before, but not at the Premier Inn.

The initial walk in however was rather unpleasant. We were hit with a strong stale smell of either industrial cheap air freshener or a damp smell.

The next thing we saw was a display on reception stating no-one was covering the reception and we should ring the bell. It was promptly answered and we dealt with one of the best receptionists I have ever experienced on all my stays in any hotel. The member of staff in question was called Sarah and she was friendly, polite and knowledgeable of the surrounding area. As we were early we did not get into our room immediately (which was very professionally explained - all rooms were busy and rooms were being cleaned. Absolutely understandable as we were early.) Our bag was taken and we were given several recommendations for shopping and lunch in the surrounding area. I highly recommend the nearby \"Lime\" restaurant. Superb food in a really nice relaxed atmosphere. When we came back shortly after the allowed check in time we were allocated a room quickly and told it was being changed to the quieter side of the building - an added extra little touch that made Sarah superior to all receptionists out there. We got up to the room however to find our allocated room wide open and obviously not ready as we were expecting. Housekeeping staff superbly handled this over sight with a quick phone call and a room move. Personal accountability in this hotel is superb, were some house keeping staff I have experienced would have just shrugged their shoulders.

The room was not impressive, it had dated fixtures such as an old fashioned fat chunky tv, no air conditioning, a window that hardly opened with condensation in the glass, only an old fashioned floor fan to attempt to regulate the temperature and a TV with limited volume. The room was too warm and stuffy due to the ventilation problems. When it came to the famous all you can eat breakfast well it wasn't so straight forward. Firstly you were asked to choose between a cooked or continental breakfast. We went for the cooked breakfast where you were required to place an order, it made you less likely to then ask for more once you had finished. In previous Premier Inns the whole breakfast both continental and cooked were buffet style help yourself and you could pick and choose from both for one price, it was excellent. At this hotel you have a choice on basics such as the sausages; my friend hated them and couldn't eat them! Sounds petty but on top of everything else we just couldn't wait to leave.

We ended up using the tram as it was so easy and only 5 mins walk to the tram stop. We opted for the meal deal which was very good value - the breakfast being particularly good. We had expected a buffet where the hot food would be pre-prepared but everything was cooked fresh to order. The breakfast waitress was very pleasant and so were the housekeeping staff - everyone said good morning and smiled which is such a change from many places. The location is fantastic just at the side of the canal - 5 mins walk to the Lowry shopping outlet, 15 mins walk to Man Utd and several restaurants nearby. Unfortunately the weather was awful and the canal was iced over so we have decided to visit again in the summer when we can have a good walk round the area.","title":"\u201cGreat hotel\u201d","location":5,"service":5,"value":5,"cleanliness":4,"date":"29 December 2010","sleepQ":5,"rooms":4},{"text":"I paid £75 for a night which was expensive for this basic hotel.

I found Salford Quays to be a bit of a concrete jungle, but the Premier Inn is located in a pleasant area away from the tower blocks and next to the water. Access is relatively easy from the centre of Manchester by tram (Eccles tram, alighting at Salford Quays or Harbour City). I was a little apprehensive, as I had not been over-impressed with the Premier Inn at Manchester Airport a week earlier. The hotel is relatively small and there was just one receptionist. She was extremely enthusiastic and helpful, creating a very favourable first impression. This is not one of the new Premier Inns, so the decor feels a touch tired but is acceptable for the price. My double room was at the back of the building, so unfortunately did not have a waterfront view. It was of a good size with basic but adequate furniture. The TV was old and I felt it should have been replaced with an LCD TV by now. There was a little noise from the road but this did not prove problematic in the night. In fact, the bed was superbly comfortable and I enjoyed one of the best night's sleep I've ever had in a hotel. The bathroom was well equipped with a toilet, washbasin and bath with shower. This bathroom was better equipped than the one I had at Manchester Airport, having proper toilet rolls, although wall-mounted liquid soap dispensers were again in evidence which are just not suitable for baths. The hotel does not have its own dining room. Food is served next door in the Beefeater restaurant, which is only a few steps away. I had dinner in the restaurant, which was very reasonable as I was able to take advantage of one of their offers. Continental breakfast is also served there, which was pretty good for an additional cost of a little over £5. Overall, this hotel provides a perfectly good base for a short stay, particularly if you are attending an event at the nearby Lowry Theatre.","title":"\u201cGood basic accommodation for a theatre visit\u201d","location":4,"service":4,"value":5,"cleanliness":4,"date":"22 August 2010","sleepQ":5,"rooms":3},{"text":"well on arrival i wanted to book a extra night and Sarah went 100% to help us went in the beefeater next door for dinner and a tex to my phone within 15 mins to say your room is booked for 2 nights? well that's service and shaz well she's top's nothing to trouble to help and Evan the night man was chatty,and the staff at the beefeater well bob on they were so help full and the food and price was excellent thanks to all for a great e/end at the QUAY'S mick n max xx","title":"\u201cgreat staff\u201d","location":5,"service":5,"value":5,"cleanliness":5,"date":"25 July 2010","sleepQ":5,"rooms":5},{"text":"A confortable and welcoming hotel, ideal for those away on business.
